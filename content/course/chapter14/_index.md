# CT, Language, and Writing
## What Is Language? 
Language is a system of communication that uses symbols, such as words, and a set of rules called a "grammar" to make meaningful statements.

We can use the rules to combine the symbols into a practically unlimited number of meaningful statements.

## How Does Language Support Thinking?
Language provides a way to externalize our thinking, making it observable. 

Writing is a good tool for helping us reflect on the quality of our thinking because it allows us and others to observe and evaluate how we have represented our thinking in words. 

## Persuasion
Persuasion: Trying to convince someone of a particular conclusion, sometimes without much concern for truth. 

Persuasive messages can be nonverbal, such as pictures, but they are often presented in the form of language.

Persuasion is used in advertisements, political ads, the classroom, and most other settings and situations. 

## Propaganda 
Propaganda: Communication that attempts to convince people to behave a certain way or adopt a certain position.

Propaganda becomes dangerous when politicians use inflammatory language to whip up hatred of an enemy.

When we like the message of propaganda, we call it educational. 

### Nazi Propaganda
Nazi Germans during World War II used anti-Semitic essays and posters, like for the movie The Eternal Jew, as propaganda tools.

## Emotive Language
Emotive language: Words and phrases with positive or negative associations that are linked to parts of arguments to sway or influence others.

Example: in nineteenth-century America, it was common to refer to Native Americans as "savages," justifying their mistreatment and confiscation of their lands.

### Attacking the Person
Attacking the man or person: The person making the argument criticizes someone who endorses an opposing view, instead of addressing the claim or argument the person is making.

Example: A politician says, "Senator Jones is a crook who has taken illegal bribes. Why should you listen to his proposal?" The politician is deflecting attention from the senator's proposal by attacking the senator as a person.

## Euphemism
Euphemism: Use of language to put a positive spin on ideas by substituting a positive expression for a negative one. 

Example: A spokesman for the Defense Department says, "We should continue the use of drones to attack the enemy because it has turned the war around and the collateral damage [civilian deaths] is minimal."

## Clarity and Language That Impedes It
Clarity in communication refers to precision in meaning that is communicated between a sender and a receiver.

People may use a variety of strategies that impede clear communication, which in turn can lead to confusion, misunderstanding, and wrong inferences about the ideas being communicated.

## Inadequate Comparisons
Inadequate comparisons: When a comparison group is not mentioned or when a comparison is made that is not relevant or appropriate. 

Example: An advertiser says that its product is "the best" without specifying the reference group or identifying what makes it the best.

## Weasel Words
Weasel words: Words that hedge or qualify claims so much that they begin to lose their meaning.

Example: The side effects of the drug are relatively harmless.
 
## Vagueness
Vagueness: Use of imprecise words-that is, words that do not have clear boundaries.

Example: The word "rich" specifies wealth at the high end, but is rather imprecise at lower values (Basham et al., 2004). Oprah Winfrey is rich, but is the physician who makes $250,000 per year also rich? 
## Pseudo-profound Bullshit
Pseudo-profound bullshit: A kind of vague language use that may seem to convey profound meaning, but that is actually a set of buzzwords put together. 

Example: "Attention and intention are the mechanics of manifestation" (Chopra, cited in Pennycock et al., 2015, p. 550).

## Ambiguous Language 
Ambiguous language: Words or expressions that can be interpreted in more than one way, so that their use reduces the clarity and specificity of expression.

Example: "Morgan ate the ice cream with relish" is ambiguous because the word "relish" has two meanings. It could mean with a pickle garnish or with gusto.

## Equivocation
Equivocation: Someone making an argument shifts the meaning of an important term from its original meaning to a different one.

Example: "Only man is rational. No woman is a man. Therefore, no woman is rational." This particularly objectionable example shows a shift from "man" as referring to "humans" to the different meaning of "man" as a sex different from "woman."

## Impediments to Clarity and Fixes
| Name | Description  | How to Fix or Avoid it|
|-|-|-|
|Inadequate comparison|Failing to make a sufficient or adequate comparison when a comparison is implied|Complete a contrast or comparison with a group, person, or condition.|
|Weasel words|Words that qualify or hedge so much that statements lose their force or importance|Use words to describe conclusions that qualify them only as much as the strength of the evidence supports.|
|Vagueness|Using words that are imprecise, abstract, or too general|Use the most specific and precise words you can.|
|Ambiguity|Using a word or making a statement that has more than one meaning or interpretation|Use words/statements with a single meaning in a particular context.|
|Equivocation|Shifting the meaning of an important word in an argument from its original meaning to a different one|Define important terms and stick to the same meaning.|

## Writing Is a Demanding Task
Writing places great demands on attention and working memory.

Unfortunately, studies suggest that the U.S. educational system is not doing enough to prepare students to think critically through writing.

Fortunately, writing may be improved by reducing the cognitive load on the writer. One way is to break the writing process into manageable steps.

|Process| Description  |Strategies/Actions|
|-|-|-|
| Collecting information| Finding background information on the topic, recording, and summarizing it| Read about the topic and take notes, Conduct research on the topic, Listen to lectures and other sources, Observe the writing of others|
| Planning| Creating and organizing ideas & Setting goals for writing| Organize notes, Outline important points, Write down goals|
| Translating ideas into text| Generating sentences & Drafting| Use focused rewriting, Compose a first draft|
| Reviewing|Reading the text as it develops,  Evaluating how well it executes the plan & Editing and revising as needed| Read what has already been written, Compare it to the goals for the task, Edit errors in the text, Make global revisions as needed|

## Writing Is Not Linear
Sometimes after planning, we need to go back and collect more information.

Sometimes after translating ideas into sentences, we need to revise our plan.

Sometimes after reviewing what we have written, we need to generate a new sentence.

## What Should You Write?
Pick a topic that interests you and that has adequate information available.

To effectively answer an essay question, you must identify the kind of essay required.

The essay prompt provides clues for the kind of response and writing required.

## Essay Questions and Prompts

|Type of Question|Description|Prompt Words|
|-|-|-|
|**Knowledge**|Identify what you remember pertaining to the question|*List, Describe, Name, Define Identify, Who, What, When*|
|**Comprehension**|Show you understand the relevant terms and concepts you remember, using your own words|*Paraphrase, Summarize, Explain, Review, Discuss, Interpret, How, Why*|
|**Application**|Use your knowledge to go beyond simple recall and understanding to solve a problem or make something|*Apply, Construct, Simulate, Employ, Predict, Show how*|
|**Analysis**|Break something down into its component parts so that it can be understood|*Classify, Distinguish, Differentiate, Compare, Contrast, Categorize, Break down*|
|**Synthesis**|Bring together different knowledge or concepts in a unified response|*Combine, Relate, Put together, Integrate*|
|**Evaluation**|Judge whether something is good or bad, true or false, or reaches some criterion|*Judge, Argue, Assess, Appraise, Decide, Defend, Debate, Evaluate, Choose, Justify*|

## Critical Thinking Essays versus Persuasive Essays 
A critical thinking essay focuses on evaluating all the important, relevant evidence on each side of a question.

A persuasive essay typically focuses on convincing the reader that one side is right. 

## Why Outlines Can Aid Writing
Students who first developed an outline wrote better than students who did not make an outline (Kellogg, 1988).

Outlines can help you organize the information.

Outlines can help you remember important points you want to make, reducing the cognitive load. 

### Outline Structure
**1. Introduction of the basic problem or question**

A. Purpose in writing the paper

B. How the problem will be discussed in the paper (What are the sides of the question?)

C. Definition of relevant terms

**2. Development of the discussion of the problem**

A. Evidence supporting a position, claim, or hypothesis

* Specific bit of evidence supporting one aspect of the claim (What is its quality?)
* Specific bit of evidence supporting another aspect of the claim (What is its quality?)
* Additional evidence (What is its quality?)
* Response to rebuttals and criticisms of evidence presented

B. Evidence against or supporting a rival position, claim, or hypothesis

* Specific bit of evidence supporting one aspect of the rival claim (What is its quality?)
* Specific bit of evidence supporting another aspect of the rival claim (What is its quality?)
* Additional evidence (What is its quality?)
* Response to rebuttals and criticisms of evidence supporting the rival claim

**3. Conclusion**

A. Evaluation of the quality and quantity of the evidence on each side

B. Drawing a well-reasoned inductive conclusion from the review and evaluation of the evidence

#### Translating Ideas into Text
Using your outline to help you keep in mind the organization of your ideas should help you actually turn those ideas into clear and coherent sentences.

Keep your audience in mind as you write, asking yourself whether the reader can understand and follow what you are writing. 

## Clarity in Writing
Writing clearly means constructing sentences that can be understood by your audience.

Use the simplest, most relevant words conventionally used by psychologists to convey your idea.

## Coherence
Good writing is coherent, and the ideas are logically connected.

Write so that the reader can follow your reasoning. 

Hint: Use the language of argumentation to guide the reader from idea to idea and from reasons to conclusions. 

## Four Common Ways Plagiarism Occurs 
1. You fail to cite someone else's idea you are using.

2. You use someone else's words without citing them.

3. You use the exact words of someone else without putting them in quotation marks (even if you cited them). 

4. You pretend that you are the author of some work actually done by someone else. 

*Adapted from Beins and Beins (2012)* 

## Citing Evidence
Citing evidence gives appropriate credit to the authors or sources.

It can increase the credibility of the evidence.

It can also provide information to help readers access and further evaluate the evidence. 

### Summarizing Evidence
A study you cite should summarize 

* What was tested (the hypothesis) 
* What was found
* How the evidence supports or does not support a side, taking into account the quality of the evidence

## The Need for Making Counterarguments
A good counterargument may weaken support for the other side or call into question evidence that has already been presented.

If a good second counterargument is offered to rebut the first counterargument, readers may be especially persuaded. 

## Reviewing and Revising
Pianko (1979) found that first-year college students spent less than 10% of their writing time in reading and revising what they had written-a missed opportunity. 

Reflecting on the quality of what you have written allows you to find errors, fix them, and otherwise improve your document.
