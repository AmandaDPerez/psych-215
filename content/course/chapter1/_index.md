## How Scientists Approach Their Work

Scientists are empiricists.

Scientists test theories: the theory-data cycle.

Scientists tackle applied and basic problems.

Scientists dig deeper.

Scientists make it public: the publication process.

Scientists talk to the world: from journal to journalism.

## Scientists Are Empiricists
**Empiricism** (aka the empirical method or empirical research)

Empiricists base their conclusions on evidence from the senses or from instruments that can help the senses.  
 
### Scientists Test Theories: The Theory-Data Cycle

Example: [Cupboard theory versus contact comfort theory in monkeys.](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/harlows-classic-studies-revealed-the-importance-of-maternal-contact.html)

### Scientists Test Theories: The Theory-Data Cycle
**Good scientific theories:**

Supported by data

Falsifiable

Have parsimony

Don't prove anything (weight of the evidence)
 
## Scientists Tackle Applied and Basic Problems

**Applied research:** conducted in order to solve practical problems; the word applied means that the findings will be directly applied to finding a solution to a real-world problem. Example: conducting a study to determine the best method for teaching young children how to read.

**Basic research:** The goal is to enhance the general body of knowledge about a particular topic. Example: conducting a study to investigate what 9-month-old infants can remember about hidden objects. Basic research can often be a foundation for later applied studies.

### Scientists Tackle Applied and Basic Problems
**Translational research:** a bridge from basic to applied research in which findings from basic research are then used to develop applications. 

## Scientists Dig Deeper
Mrazek and his team did not stop after only one study of mindfulness training and GRE performance. They dug deeper. They also asked whether mindfulness training was especially helpful for people whose minds wander the most.


## Scientists Make it Public

*How do scientists share the results of their research with the scientific community?*

**Submit it to a scientific journal:** They are periodicals that typically are published every month. The articles in journals are peer-reviewed and written by qualified contributors. You might explain how the peer-review process works and how it is a gatekeeper for scientific rigor. The audience for journals is scientists and psychology students.
