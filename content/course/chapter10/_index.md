# Analyzing a Psychological Question: Are People Basically Selfish?

## Defining Terms: Altruism versus Egoism
**Altruism:** Helping or aiding another *without the intention of receiving any benefit in return* (Schroeder et al., 1995).

**Egoism:** Selfishness.

## Perspective Taking
Improves understanding of the other side of a question by adopting the viewpoint offered by another person.

Helps someone making an argument examine assumptions from the perspective of the other side. This may help root out the unwarranted assumptions people make in defending their own favored position. 

## What Do Different Perspectives Offer?
**Biopsychological:** Genetic, evolutionary, and brain basis of helping behavior 

**Social psychological:** Traits, motives, and social influences on behaviors of individuals that influence helping

**Developmental psychological:** The changes in helping that occur as a person develops or matures

**Philosophical:** Ethical issues and careful consideration in defining our terms 

## Biological Perspective: Evidence against Altruism, Supporting Egoism
Summary: Trivers (1971) proposed that organisms are more likely to help offspring and close relatives, and this tendency would be preserved genetically as kin selection.

**Reciprocal altruism:** A mechanism for helping an unrelated individual when it is likely that the individual being helped will reciprocate and return the favor. 

Quality and quantity: Scientific authority/expert on evolution.

Summary: Dawkins' idea of the "selfish gene": Only an individual can pass along genes for a trait. A person who helps another puts himself at risk and depletes his own resources, making it less likely that he will pass along his trait for altruism to his offspring.

Quality and quantity: Scientific authority on evolution

### People Help Kin
Summary: Two studies found people more likely to help kin (Burnstein et al., 1994; Mainer & Gailliot, 2007). 

Quality and quantity: Burnstein et al. (1994) was a scientific study. Mainer and Gailliot (2007) was a true, high-quality experiment.

### Supporting Reciprocal Altruism
Summary: Wilkinson described how bats will regurgitate blood for other hungry bats, who reciprocate this behavior later. 

Quality and quantity: Statement of scientific authority, but is a secondary source and example is of nonhumans.

## Empathy
Empathy is a feeling that allows a person to understand the suffering of another, creating a motive to help relieve the suffering.

The inheritance or biological basis of this trait could underlie altruism.

### Research on Innate Basis of Empathy
Summary: Hoffman (1981) argued that empathy is a mechanism underlying altruism that evolved in humans.

Quality and quantity: Scientific authority in a literature review that is high quality, but dated. 

Summary: Preston and de Waal (2002) did a review showing empathy in monkeys and apes. 

Quality and quantity: Scientific authority, literature review of several studies by experts in the area-high quality. 

### Heritability
Matthews et al. (1981) found at least a partial genetic contribution for empathy and altruism.

Heritability studies are like correlational studies, so they cannot show that genes cause a behavior.

It is a misconception to think that a high heritability score for a trait means it causes a behavior or that it cannot change.

### Empathy Does Not Support Altruism 
Summary: Batson, Bolen, Cross, and Neuringer-Benefiel (1986) found that showing more empathy tended to be related to avoiding feeling guilt (a selfish reason).

Quality and quantity: A correlational study that cannot show cause and effect.

Summary: Cialdini et al. (1987) found that empathic subjects did not help much when they were led to believe that their moods would not be changed if they helped another person.

Quality and quantity: A true experiment, of high quality, which may show cause and effect.

## Bystander Effect
Kitty Genovese was attacked late at night, with many residents in the area becoming aware of her plight. They did little to intervene, not even calling the police until hours later. 

The story inspired a national debate about apathy as well as studies on helping behavior and the bystander effect.

The facts of the case have been disputed, with some evidence suggesting that observers did act to help to some degree.

### Darley and Latane (1968) Experiment
Situation: Participants were in a room where they could hear a person having what sounded like a seizure.

The researchers randomly assigned people to two groups: 

* One group of participants tested thought they were alone.
* A second group thought other people could hear the person having the seizure.

Dependent variable: Whether the participant helped.   

#### Results
In the group who thought they were alone, 85% tried to get help for the victim.

*In the group who thought others were around, only 30% sought help.* 

More people available to help leads to more **diffusion of responsibility**.

In other words, people are more likely to help if they are the only person who is around.

## Helping Depends on Observing a Helping Model
Summary: A study by Bryan and Test (1965) found that people are more likely to help others if they first observe someone helping.

Quality and quantity: A true experiment that may allow a causal inference.

### Learning Altruism
Observing altruistic models and being put in a good mood can foster altruism.

Young children learn to be altruistic when their parents communicate their expectations for prosocial behavior, reward them for showing it, and punish them for failing to show it. 

## Drawing a Qualified Conclusion
Helping depends on:

* If the person needing help is kin
* Whether other people are available to help
* What mood someone is in
* Whether the person has just observed someone else helping
* Whether the helper gets a reward

Therefore, we cannot conclude that people are basically unselfish or altruistic and help no matter what.

## False Dichotomy
A false dichotomy can be described as black-and-white thinking or a false dilemma. 

A false dichotomy is created when you treat two concepts as the only alternatives. 

Consider whether there are more than selfish or altruistic motives in any given situation.
