## Inductive Reasoning

Scientists use inductive reasoning to generalize *from* evidence to draw well-reasoned conclusions from questions

Specific cases &#8594; generalization

People generalize from personal experiences to conclude that psychic prediction is real: "I once had a dream that came true."

* Dream came true (case) &#8594; I'm psychic

People use induction to predict events: "It will probably rain today because it has all week."

* Rain all week (cases) &#8594; rain today (event)

## Plausibility

**Plausibility** is how reasonable we judge a claim to be, given other things we know. We are generalizing from our previous knowledge to make a judgment about **how likely** a claim is to be true.

For psychological questions, we often use what psychology and other sciences suggest will be true.

*Is knowing the future before it happens plausible or implausible?*

### Predicting the Future

Predicting the future is **implausible** because we assume that:

* Cause (physical event occurs) leads to effect (our physical nervous system perceives it). 
* NOT: Effect (our physical nervous system perceives it) occurs before the cause (physical event occurs).

#### Lee Fried's Amazing Prediction
Lee Fried, a student, told Duke's president that he predicted an important event that would happen in the upcoming week and put it in a sealed envelope. 

The envelope was not to be opened until the end of the week.

The note inside described a jumbo jet crash that would kill hundreds of people, an unlikely event that had actually occurred that week. 

### Guarding Against Deception

Carefully examine claims, especially extraordinary ones.

Look for plausible explanations first, before jumping to a less plausible conclusion.

Some kinds of evidence, such as personal experience, may not provide good support for a claim. 

### Plausibility Is Useful
Plausibility *is useful* when making an initial judgment about how reasonable a claim appears to be, based on accurate knowledge. 

*It is not useful* when adequate knowledge does not exist. 

Plausibility judgments depend on the state of our knowledge. For example, some things that were once implausible, such as space travel, are now scientifically plausible.

### The Limits of Inductive Reasoning
Philosopher/psychologist William James noted that if we wanted to know "What color are crows?" we might observe 1,000 crows and note their color as black.

But what if the 1,001st crow we observed was white? *Observing one white crow is enough to disprove the conclusion that all crows are black.* 

#### Acknowledging the Limits of Induction
We cannot be certain all crows are black through inductive reasoning.

We cannot prove a claim or conclusion is true through induction.

*We can still generalize and conclude that most crows are black.*

## Drawing an Inductive Conclusion
We can decide whether some claim is probably true. 

The evidence we acquire is not definitive, but we reason to a conclusion from the highest-quality evidence available.

### What Makes a Strong Inductive Conclusion?
The strongest inductions are supported by the highest-quality evidence and not refuted by any other high-quality evidence.

We evaluate the quality of the evidence on two or more sides and evaluate it.

This raises the question of what makes one kind of evidence higher quality than another. 

#### Standards of Evidence
Rules, principles, and criteria are used in deciding how good some kind of evidence is.

For example, scientists value scientific research and evidence more highly than they value nonscientific evidence. 

In contrast, in everyday, nonscientific applications of inductive reasoning, people use much less formal rules. 

### Nonscientific Sources of Evidence
**Nonscientific sources of evidence** (such as personal experience, anecdotes, commonsense belief, and nonscientific authority) are based on informal observations/experiences and opinions of people.

Because they are not based on careful, systematic, and more objective observations, as are scientific sources, they provide much weaker support than is provided by scientific sources. 

#### Personal Experience

* Personal experience is a type of nonscientific evidence in which someone reports of his or her own experience, often in the form of testimonials and introspective self-reports, as evidence.
* It tells what a person may be feeling, experiencing, or aware of at the time.
* People can identify with personal experience because it is compelling and vivid. 

**Personal Experience: Weaknesses**

* Personal experience is often subjective, biased, and prone to perceptual and other cognitive errors.  
* This can make personal experience inaccurate.
* It may be unreliable because people are often unaware of the unconscious reasons for their behaviors and experiences.

#### Perceptual Illusions
**Perceptual illusions** can make personal experience inaccurate.

**Illusions** are systematic errors in perception, such as the [Mueller-Lyer illusion](https://www.illusionsindex.org/ir/mueller-lyer).

#### Naive Realism 
People show **naive realism** by believing that they accurately perceive the world, just as it really is.

An common phrase that demonstrates naive realism is "Seeing is believing."

Due to naive realism, people assume that what they perceive is accurate, real, and trustworthy, even when it is not. 

#### Anecdotes
**Anecdotes** are a type of personal experience that share a story or example, often biographical, to support a claim.

An anecdote might begin, "I know someone who . . . ."

**Strengths:** Anecdotes can vividly illustrate an ability, trait, behavior, or situation with a real-world example.

**Weaknesses:** Anecdotes are not based on careful, systematic observation and may be unique, may not be repeatable, and may not generalize to many people. 

#### Commonsense Beliefs
**Commonsense beliefs** are informal beliefs and folk theories commonly assumed to be true.

They often take the form of "You know what they say . . ." or "Everyone knows that . . . ."

These consensus of opinion or popular views are then used as evidence for accepting a claim.

**Weaknesses:** Commonsense beliefs are not based on careful, systematic observation. They may be biased by cultural and social influences and often go untested.

#### Statements of Authority
Statements of authority are cited or offered in support of a claim by someone who is thought to be in a position to know about the claim.

They are frequently used as evidence in both everyday and scientific arguments. 

In scientific arguments, a good statement of authority is backed up by research studies. 

**Strengths:** These statements may be true when the authority has relevant knowledge or expertise.
They are convenient because acquiring one's own knowledge and expertise takes a lot of time.
However, these statements can be misleading when the presumed authority does not have relevant knowledge or expertise, or when that source is biased.

## Quantity and Quality of Evidence
Quantity of the evidence (how much)

* Number of studies supporting each side
* Sizes of the samples in the studies 

Quality of the evidence (how good it is)

* Kind of evidence (scientific versus nonscientific)
* How well done the scientific studies were

### What Makes a Good Theory?
A good theory is supported by more high-quality evidence and, therefore, is better justified.

It can explain more and allows for better predictions because it is consistent with more high-quality evidence than are other theories.

#### Science Versus Nonscience
Science is an approach to knowledge and inquiry that should involve good reasoning about the meaning of carefully and systematically made observations.

Nonscientific approaches are informal, paying less attention to good reasoning and the quality of observations.

## Thinking Errors
### Thinking Errors Related to Generalization
**Hasty generalization:** Drawing a general conclusion too rapidly, before sufficiently considering all the relevant evidence. 

**Sweeping generalization:** Drawing a conclusion that is too wide or goes well beyond what the evidence implies, such as over-interpreting a study's findings. 

### Thinking Errors Related to Relevance
**Red herring fallacy:** Deliberately side-tracking an argument away from the issue using irrelevant information or reasons. 

Red Herring Example:
**Interviewer:** "Senator Snide, why did you continue to support the Iraq War when it was discovered that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction?"

**Senator Snide:** "I have always been a patriot and staunch supporter or our country." 

Snide's self-avowed patriotism is irrelevant to the question of why the senator supported continuation of the Iraq War.
