# Evaluating Causal Claims

**First, watch the below video on inferring causation**

[![Data Demystified](https://img.youtube.com/vi/M1G5MO7JUgI/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1G5MO7JUgI "Causal Claims")

## Reviewing the Three Causal Criteria

**Multivariate designs** involve more than two measured variables.

Only one variable will be the dependent (outcome) variable (happiness).

So, this means in a multivariate design you have at least two independent variables (beach attendance, weather)

**Three criteria for establishing causation**

1.  Covariance

2.  Temporal precedence

3.  Internal validity

## Criterion Variables and Predictor Variables

**Criterion variable:** dependent variable, the variable that you're most interested in understanding and predicting

**Predictor variables:** independent variables

#### Multivariate Design Does Not Establish Causation

Not a foolproof way to rule out all kinds of third variables.

### Getting at Causality with Pattern and Parsimony

1.  The longer a person has smoked cigarettes, the greater are the chances of getting cancer.
2.  People who stop smoking have lower cancer rates than people who continue smoking.
3.  Smokers' cancers tend to be in the lungs and of a particular type.
4.  Smokers who use filtered cigarettes have a somewhat lower rate of cancer than smokers of unfiltered cigarettes.
5.  People who live with smokers would have higher rates of cancer, too, because of their passive exposure to the same chemicals.

## Pattern, Parsimony, and the Popular Press

Journalists do not always fairly represent pattern and **parsimony** (parsimony = simplest and most accurate explanation).

When journalists report only one study at a time, they are selectively presenting only part of the scientific process.

## Multivariate Designs and the Four Validities

**Internal validity** (already discussed): Moderators/3rd variables

**Construct validity:** It is important to interrogate the construct validities in all of your variables in multivariate designs. Are your measures reliable and valid?

**External validity:** In order to interrogate the external validity of multivariate designs, you need to consider whether the results are generalizable to other people, contexts, situations, and so forth. You would want to look at how the sample was obtained. Was it a random sample?

**Statistical validity:** To interrogate statistical validity in multivariate designs, we need to consider the effect size and the statistical significance (p value).
