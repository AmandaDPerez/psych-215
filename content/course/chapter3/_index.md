## Variables

A **variable** is something that changes or varies, so it needs to have at least two levels or values (but it can have more). 

### Variable example (made-up data)

*"80% of college undergraduates have sexted."*

Sexting is the *variable*, and there are **two levels**: those who have sent sexually explicit photos electronically, and those who have not. 

## Variables: More

Next, we will look at different types of variables: 

Measured variables

Manipulated variables

Conceptual variables

Operationalized variables

### Measured VS Manipulated Variable

**Measured variable:** observed and recorded
Some variables can only be measured-not manipulated

Levels are observed and recorded by the researcher. Ex of a measured variable include height, IQ, gender, and hair color. Psychologists also measure more abstract variables such as depression and stress.

**Manipulated variable:** controlled
Some variables can be either manipulated or measured

The researcher controls a variable, usually by assigning participants to different levels of that variable. Ex of a manipulated variable, a researcher might assign some people to take a test in a room with many other people and assign others to take the test alone. 

**Some variables can only be measured-not manipulated:** 

You cannot assign participants to be a particular age, as age is a naturally occurring variable. Also, sometimes it is unethical to manipulate variables. For ex, in a study on the long-term effects of elementary education, you could not ethically assign children to "high-quality school" and "low-quality school" conditions. 


**Some variables can be either manipulated or measured:**

For example, if childhood extracurricular activities were the variable of interest, you could measure whether children already take music or drama lessons, or you could manipulate this variable by assigning some children to take music lessons and others to take drama lessons. 

## Operational Definition

In order to test hypotheses with empirical data, researchers need to develop **operational definitions**, or operational variables. 
To operationalize is to turn a conceptual definition into a measured or manipulated variable. 
*This is how you will measure your variable*

For example, say you want to measure participant's fear while watching a horror movie. How will you operationally define fear? Will you record their facial behavior? Measure heart rates? Or have them fill out surveys? These are all examples of different ways to operationally define fear.

## Three Claims

**Claim:** An argument someone is trying to make. Psychological scientists use data to test and refine theories and claims.

Frequency Claim

Association Claim

Causal Claim

### Frequency Claim: One Variable
Describes a particular rate or degree of a single variable. Involve only one measured variable

* 4 in 10 teens admit to texting while driving
* 42% of Europeans never exercise
* Middle school kids see 2-4 alcohol ads a day
* Just 15% of Americans Smoke
* 72% of the World Smiled Yesterday

### Association Claim: Two Variables that are related
Argues that one level of a variable is likely to be associated with a particular level of another variable. Must involve at least two measured variables. **Correlation (DOES not imply causation)**

* People with Higher Incomes Spend Less Time Socializing
* Romantic Partners Who Express Gratitude Are Three Times More Likely to Stay Together
* People Who Multitask the Most Are the Worst at It

[Correlations can either be negative, positive, or zero/no correlation.](https://www.simplypsychology.org/correlation.html#:~:text=A%20positive%20correlation%20is%20a,move%20in%20the%20same%20direction.&text=A%20negative%20correlation%20is%20a,a%20decrease%20in%20the%20other.)

#### Making Predictions Based on Associations
Some association claims are useful because they help us make predictions.

The stronger the association between the two variables, the more accurate the prediction will be.

Both positive and negative associations can help us make predictions, but zero associations cannot. 


#### In the news...
In 2018, (Stoet, G., & Geary, D. C.) researchers published a study (in a reputable psych journal!) claiming:
Countries with more gender equality have fewer women earning degrees in STEM. More women studied STEM in countries with less gender-progressive policies. They called this phenomenon the "gender-equality paradox" 

Jordan Peterson (controversial psychologist who argues masculinity is in crisis) and others cited the study to argue that, free from societal constraints, women choose to stay away from technical fields - a choice they make because of an innate lack of interest, not because of the patriarchy.

**BUT** the quality of this research is fishy

Very selective set of data to produce a contrived and distorted picture of the global distribution of women in STEM achievement.

Sarah Richardson (Harvard Historian) and her colleagues at Harvard's GenderSci Lab laid out what they saw as the significant problems with the study's methodology 

These included the researchers' calculations for determining the percentage of women STEM graduates and the metrics they used to assess gender equity in each country.

i.e. the operationalization of their key variables!

They called into question the study's fundamental premise:
The correlation the authors apparently found between national gender equity and women in STEM means the former directly affects the latter.
It's just a correlation! An association claim! Not causal! Correlation DOES NOT imply causation! Issue of directionality!

In December 2019, a lengthy 1,113-word correction was added to the paper, clarifying how the researchers had arrived at their conclusions and correcting several sentences and misleading figures. 

### Causal Claim: Two Variables, one of which causes the other

* Music lessons &#8594; enhance IQ
* Babysitting &#8594; may prime brain for parenting
* Family meals &#8594; curbs eating disorders
* Why sleep deprivation &#8594; makes you crabby

## Not All Claims Are Based on Research
Not all claims we read about in the popular press are based on research. 
Some claims are based on experience, intuition, or authority.

Popular Media Examples: 

* 12-Year-Old's Insight on Autism and Vaccines Goes Viral
* Living in the Shadow of Huntington's Disease
* Baby Born Without Skull in the Back of His Head Defies Odds 

## The Four Big Validities

### Construct Validity: 
How well the variables in a study are measured or manipulated
The extent to which the operational variables in a study are a good approximation of the conceptual variables

### External Validity: 
The extent to which the results of a study generalize to some larger population (e.g., whether the results from this sample of children apply to all U.S. school children), as well as to other times or situations (e.g., whether the results based on this type of music apply to other types of music)

*Does being around babies make people happier?* Bring people into a lab & show a picture of a baby VS a more naturalistic setting (park?) with real babies

### Statistical Validity: 
The extent to which the data supports to conclusion
Among other questions, it is important to ask about the strength of an association and its statistical significant (the probability that the results could have been obtained by chance if there really is no relationship)

* Significance = p value less than .05
* p = probability
* The smaller the p-value, the more meaningful the result because it is less likely to be caused by error/noise in the data
* p < 0.05 = statistical significance!
* p < 0.01 better than p < 0.05, smaller = better

### Internal Validity: 
How well an experiment is done
Whether it avoids confounds
The less chance for confounding variables in a study, the higher its internal validity is.

*Do babies make people happier?* IF we find babies make people happier, what about the confound of being a parent or not?
A highly internally valid study will control for that by asking about parent status

## Interrogating Frequency Claims

One Variable Claim

* Construct Validity (how good our measure is)
* External Validity (generalizability)
* Statistical Validity (sometimes relevant)


*Construct Validity: How well a conceptual variable is operationalized. * Ask: How was X operationally defined? 

*80% of college students have been depressed during the last year.* How was depression operationally defined? Were college students asked if they'd ever been depressed during the last year, or was the frequency claim based on a score on a depression inventory or records from psych services on campus?


*External Validity (also known as generalizability): How well the results of a study represent the people or contexts besides those in the study itself.* Ask: Who/what did they study and in what context? Will the findings generalize beyond the study?

*72% of the world smiled yesterday.* Which people did they survey, and how did they choose their participants? Did they include only people in major urban areas? Did they ask only college students from each country? Or did they attempt to randomly select people from every region of the world? 


*Statistical Validity (also known as statistical conclusion validity): The extent to which the study's conclusion are reasonable and accurate.
* The questions asked will vary depending on the claim. When interrogating frequency claims, percentages are usually accompanied by a margin of error. 

## Interrogating Association Claims
Two measured variable claim

* Construct Validity (how good our measures are)
* External Validity (generalizability)
* Statistical Validity 

*Construct Validity: similar to construct validity for a frequency claim except that you now have two conceptual variables that need to be operationalized appropriately.* Ask: How were X and Y measured? 

*People who multitask are the worst at it. * How were the frequency and ability to multitask measured? Ability to multitask could be measured by self-report (How good are you at multitasking?) or by an observational measure in which participants are given a task that requires them to multitask. 

*External Validity: Does the association claim generalize to other populations, contexts, times, or places?* Ex: For the association between expressing gratitude and relationship length, you would ask whether the results from this study's participants, 194 California college students currently in a romantic relationship, would generalize to other people and settings. 

*Statistical Validity: When referring to an association claim, statistical validity is the extent to which the statistical conclusions are accurate and reasonable.* Aspects of statistical validity to consider: Strength and statistical significance (p < 0.05) AND Two kinds of mistakes

#### Strength: How strong is the association? 

Some associations are strong and others are weak. Remember that the stronger the association, the more accurate our predictions will be.

#### Statistical significance

If an association is statistically significant (p < 0.05), then the result is probably not due to chance based on that sample. If an association isn't statistically significant, then the result probably is due to chance.

#### Two Kinds of Mistakes

Avoiding two mistaken conclusions: When interrogating the statistical validity of an association claim, there are two kinds of mistakes that can be made.

**Type I error:** False positive; a study might mistakenly conclude that there is an association between two variables in their sample when there actually is no association in the population. 
You want to increase the chances that you will find an association only when there really is an association.


**Type II error:** False negative; a "miss"; a study might mistakenly conclude from a sample that there is no association between two variables when there actually is an association in the population. 
You want to minimize, or at least reduce, the chances of missing associations that are really there.  

## Interrogating Causal Claims

Because causal claims state that one variable causes another variable, they use directional verbs like leads to, affects, and influences. 

**Three criteria for causation:** 

Covariance

Temporal precedence

Internal Validity

### Covariance: 
This simply means that the two variables are related. Association claims fulfill this criterion. 
Ex. The study's results show that as A changes, B changes. Positive association OR Negative association (correlation)

### Temporal precedence: 
One variable comes before the other variable in time.

Because the researcher is manipulating one variable and then measuring the other variable, they know the manipulated variable comes before the outcome variable, which is measured after the manipulation. 

Ex. The study's method ensures that A comes first in time, before B. A &#8594; B

### Internal validity (also known as the third-variable criterion): 

A study should be able to eliminate alternative explanation (confounds). 

In other words, Variable A is the only thing that changed. The study's method ensures that there are no plausible alternative explanations for the change in B, A is the only thing that changed.

### Experiments Can Support Causal Claims

In order to support a causal claim, a researcher needs to conduct an experiment in which one variable is manipulated and the other is measured.

* Independent Variable(s) (Manipulated)
* Dependent Variable (only one! Measured)
* Random Assignment

**Independent Variable:** manipulated variable (cause) in an experiment (e.g., type of lessons; four levels: keyboard, voice, drama, no lessons).  

**Dependent variable:** measured variable (effect) in an experiment (e.g., IQ)

**Type of lesson (IV) &#8594; IQ increase (DV)**

#### Random assignment: 

A method of assigning participants to levels of the independent variable such that each group is as similar as possible; flipping a coin or rolling a die; increases internal validity by controlling for potential alternative explanations. 

Ex: We know that it was the lessons that caused the differences in IQ and not something else because IQ was similar in the four groups due to random assignment.  

## When Causal Claims Are a Mistake

Sometimes an article in the popular press may sound like it's a causal claim when really it's not. Here are two examples:

*Does eating meals as a family really curb eating disorders?*
Covariance: Yes, there is an association between family meals and eating disorders. 

Temporal precedence: Did the family meals increase before the eating disorders decreased? It's not clear. 

Internal validity: No. We can't rule out third variable explanations without an experiment.  

Other possible explanation (confound) Perhaps girls from single-parent families are less likely to eat with their families and are vulnerable to eating disorders, whereas girls who live with both parents are not. 


*Does social media pressure cause teen anxiety?*

Covariance: Yes. The results showed that teens who felt more pressure to respond immediately to social media were also more anxious. 

Temporal precedence: No. this was a correlational study, in which both variables were measured at the same time 

Internal validity: No. It was not an experiment so it did not rule out possible alternative explanations.  


## Other Validities to Interrogate
We have been emphasizing internal validity because it is only important when interrogating causal claims. However, we still need to consider the three other types of validity:

* Construct validity (operational definitions): Always important regardless of what kind of claim you're making; need to consider the construct validity of both the manipulated variable and the measured variable

* External validity (generalizability):  Do the results generalize to other people or contexts? This probably isn't paramount since internal validity tends to be emphasized in experiments, and internal and external validity are kind of like two sides of a coin. As internal validity increases, external validity decreases and vice versa

* Statistical validity (statistical significance): How strong is the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable? Is the difference between groups statistically significant?

## Which of the four validities is the most important?

Which of the four validities is the most important?
It depends on what kind of claim the researcher is making and the researcher's priorities.

It's impossible to find a study that satisfies all four validities at once. Researchers must decide on their priorities according to the goals of the study. 

Ex: Internal validity is typically a top priority when making causal claims but not when making frequency or association claims.
