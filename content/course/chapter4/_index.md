## Tuskegee Study

**Quick Summary** ([Great vids out there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KL7lcWMkz0))
Black men (with syphilis) were monitored but only given placebos, despite the fact penicillin became the recommended treatment for syphilis in 1947. Researchers convinced local physicians in Macon County not to treat the participants, and research was done at the Tuskegee Institute.

### Unethical Choices
The participants were not treated respectfully

The participants were harmed

The participants were a targeted, disadvantaged social group

**The participants were not treated respectfully**

They were not told whether or not they had syphilis, were not informed about cures that became available during the course of the study, they may have felt coerced to participate because of the generous burial fee provided to families, and they did not provide informed consent for their participation.

**The participants were harmed**

They were not told about penicillin as a treatment for syphilis, which would have cured those who were infected. Many of the men in the study could not even read and so were unlikely to even to learn of this treatment. Moreover, some of the tests participants underwent were painful and potentially dangerous (e.g., spinal taps). 

**The participants were a targeted, disadvantaged social group**

The men in this study were African American and poor, even though people from all races and socioeconomic backgrounds were affected by syphilis at the time.

## Milgram & Ethical Balance

*"The Milgram experiment was carried out many times whereby Milgram (1965) varied the basic procedure (changed the IV). By doing this Milgram could identify which factors affected obedience (the DV). Obedience was measured by how many participants shocked to the maximum 450 volts (65% in the original study)." - Simplypsychology.org*

**Ethical questions:**

Was it ethical to put teacher-participants through such a stressful experience? 

Were there any lasting effects of the study after participants had been debriefed (informed that they did not actually shock the learner)? 

Some participants reported that even though they understood following the debriefing that they did not actually harm anyone, they still thought about the fact that they were willing to harm another individual for a long time afterward.

## Belmont Report 3 Principles: 

Principle of respect for persons

Principle of beneficence

Principle of justice

### Principle of respect for persons 

Should be free to decide for themselves whether they would like to participate in a study

Entitled to *informed consent* (information about the risks and benefits of the research), so that they can decide whether to participate in an informed manner

Certain groups of people are entitled to special protection in terms of informed consent. 

These individuals include children, people with cognitive disabilities, and prisoners. Sometimes these people might not be able to give informed consent (e.g., children), and so informed consent will be obtained from the parent or guardian


### Principle of beneficence

The word **beneficence** refers to the doing of good. Researchers need to take measures to protect participants from harm and to ensure their well-being. This includes researchers weighing risks and benefits of their research, and also considering who might benefit from the research and who might be harmed. 


### Principle of justice

This principle looks at the balance between those who participate in the research and those who benefit from it: Who bears the risk and who reaps the benefits? Think: Tuskegee Syphilis Study. 


## APA Ethical Principles

Belmont + 2:

1. Fidelity and responsibility

2. Integrity

### Principle of beneficence: Fidelity & responsibility

Establish relationships of trust; accept responsibility for professional behavior (in research, teaching, and clinical practice)

### Principle of beneficence: Integrity

Strive to be accurate, truthful, and honest in one's role as researcher, teacher, or practitioner

## APA Ethical Standards for Research

### Standard 8: Specific to research

Institutional review boards

Informed consent

Deception

Debriefing

Misconduct

Animal Research

### Institutional review boards (IRB)
These boards are responsible for making sure that research using humans as participants is conducted ethically

### Informed consent
Explanation of the study must be provided in a written format before a person agrees to participate; the participant signs two forms (keeps one and gives one to researcher)

### Deception
There are two types of deception-**omission** (withholding details of the study from participants) and **commission** (lying to participants)

### Debriefing
When researchers use deception, they must debrief participants following their participation
Debriefing sessions are typically conducted verbally, and the researcher explains why deception was used and the nature of the deception

### Misconduct

**Data fabrication** (researchers invent data that fit their hypotheses) and data falsification (researchers selectively delete observations or influence participants to act in a particular way)

**Plagiarism** is representing the words or ideas of others as your own. Remember to cite your sources in order to avoid plagiarism

### Animal research
Some psychologists conduct research on nonhumans (e.g., insects, primates, or rodents), and we need to make sure that these animals are treated well and protected from suffering

## Ethical Decision Making: A Thoughtful Balance
Ethical decision making requires a balance of priorities

We need to weigh the potential harm to human or animal participants against what the knowledge gained from the research will contribute to society

Ethical research practice is an ongoing and dynamic process of balance
