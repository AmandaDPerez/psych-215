## CT in Everyday life

Who believes that the moon affects behavior?

* Nearly 81% of mental health professionals, according to Owens and McGowan (2006)
* Many college students; 45% in a study by Russell and Dua (1983) and nearly 40% in a study by Bensley and Lilienfeld (2015)

### Moon Truth
The moon does not cause people to behave abnormally. 

Psychiatric admissions do not increase during a full moon.

A full moon does not lead to more suicides.

In a review of 37 studies, Rotton and Kelly (1985) found no good evidence that any phase of the moon increased abnormal behavior. 

### Where do our opinions come from?

People have common sense beliefs that they use to explain behaviors and mental states even before they study psychology. 

Many of your ideas come from your culture and from personal experience.

### The purpose of critical thinking
Critical thinking will teach you *how* to think, not *what* to think.

Critical thinking (CT) is an approach that can help you think effectively about ideas. 

## What is CT?
Critical thinking is reflective thinking involved in evaluating evidence relevant to a claim so that a well-reasoned conclusion can be drawn from the evidence.

**Reflective thinking** refers to thinking about thinking.

**Evaluating evidence relevant to a claim** refers to examining the reasons that support or do not support a claim.

This is what we do when we reason about the truth of statements.

### Well-Reasoned Conclusions
The phrase “so that a well-reasoned conclusion can be drawn from the evidence” means that the thinking is sound, logical, and fair. For example, a well-reasoned conclusion might be a correct inference, a sound judgment or decision, or an accurate diagnosis of someone.

### Where Does “Critical” Come From?
**Critical** comes from the Greek word crites, meaning “judge,” and is related to criterion, meaning “the means of judgment.” Compare critical to criteria and criterion—terms critical thinkers use to refer to standards they use to make judgments. For example, psychologists use criteria to accurately diagnose mental disorders in clients.

### Which Claims Should We Accept?
Critical thinkers use criteria and standards to decide which claims to accept. Although everyone is entitled to their opinion, some opinions, ideas, and theories can be shown to be better than others when we use the appropriate criteria and standards to decide which is more accurate.

### Some Theories Are Better Than Others
Opponents of Darwin’s theory of evolution sometimes say, “It’s just a theory,” implying it is no better than any other theory. Darwin’s theory has been shown to be one of the best-supported and most powerful theories in all of science, based on scientific standards of evidence.

#### What Is Darwin’s Theory?
Organisms change gradually over time (evolve) but show continuity with their relatives. Natural selection: Organisms that have a trait or characteristic that helps them survive in their environment will tend to survive long enough to reproduce and pass that trait on to their offspring.

#### What Makes Darwin’s Theory a Good Scientific Theory?
“A theory is a set of general principles that attempts to explain and predict or other phenomena” (Myers & Hansen, 2012). Darwin’s theory is scientifically sound because it makes accurate predictions and helps to explain questions posed about the world. For example, Darwin’s theory of evolution can help explain how dogs evolved from wolves.

#### Example: “Round earth theory” is better than “flat earth theory.”
The “round earth” theory is better because it makes more accurate predictions than the “flat earth theory” (Asimov, 1989). The “flat earth” theory may appear to be true from ordinary visual experience, but higher-quality scientific evidence, such as pictures of Earth from space, refute it. 

### Belief Perseverance
Belief perseverance: a thinking error in which people refuse to revise or reject their faulty belief when confronted with evidence clearly refuting it. Creationists persist in denying the reality of evolution, despite evidence clearly demonstrating that Darwin’s theory is better. Flat-earthers continue to believe that the Earth is flat despite satellite photos of a round Earth.

## Thinking Errors
**Thinking errors** are mistakes in judgment and reasoning, such as logical errors and other failures to think critically. They also reveal the need to improve thinking.

**Thinking Errors Can Be Costly:** Ponzi schemes, like that undertaken by Bernard Madoff, who “made off” with $64 billion of investors’ money, depend on victims believing in a scheme that is too good to be true. Madoff’s victims included Steven Spielberg, Kevin Bacon, and many charities. Credit card debt actually means that someone takes out a high-interest loan and may over-estimate his or her ability to pay it off.

### Psychological Misconceptions
Psychological misconceptions are commonsense mistaken ideas about behavior and mental processes that have not been supported by research in psychology. For example, the idea that the full moon makes people behave abnormally is a psychological misconception.

### Superstitions
Superstitions are beliefs that are inconsistent with what is known in science. They are often supernatural beliefs about objects or entities that bring good luck, bad luck, or misfortune.	

## What It Takes to Think Critically
* Knowledge of reasoning and CT skills 
* Topical knowledge 
* Awareness of one’s own thinking and how to regulate it
* CT dispositions

### CT Knowledge and Skills
Knowledge of the rules for reasoning that underlie the ability to reason well in different situations. Includes skills for distinguishing arguments from non-arguments, and for recognizing thinking errors

### Topical Knowledge
Background knowledge relevant to the subject of a question needed to reason about the question. For example, if you do not know anything about evolutionary theory, it would be hard to reason about it. 

### Metacognition
Awareness of one’s own thinking and how to regulate it is also known as **metacognition**. 
To monitor and regulate thinking, you have to know the limits of your knowledge and thinking skills.

### CT Dispositions
**CT dispositions** are attitudes, traits, thinking styles, and motives that make it more likely a person will think critically. 

Examples CT Dispositions:
* Open-mindedness: a willingness to examine new ideas.
* Fair-mindedness: a willingness to examine ideas on the other side.
* Skeptical attitude: a tendency to question and seek evidence for new claims before believing them.

#### Disposition Example: Doyle
Arthur Conan Doyle’s lack of a skeptical attitude is shown in his belief in Spiritualism and fairies. 

Doyle had good CT skills that he used as a medical doctor and in writing about Sherlock Holms, the detective known for his super ability to reason. 
Even so, Doyle was not disposed (i.e. **selective CT** to use those CT skills to think critically about beliefs he favored, despite evidence to the contrary.

## Type 2 Thinking
Critical thinkers often use Type 2 thinking for important questions. They take a slower, deliberate approach on important questions, such as deciding which theory of learning is the best theory. They use standards of evidence to analyze the relevant information and evidence evaluating its quality to draw a well-reasoned conclusion.

## Arguments
When people think critically, they often make and evaluate arguments. A **basic argument** is a claim or conclusion taken along with evidence.

## Claims
A **claim** is a statement asserting that someone or something has a particular characteristic or property; it has a truth value. Claims can be opinions, beliefs, hypotheses, theoretical statements, and statements made in conversations and legal proceedings.

## Opinions
**Opinions** are not persuasive unless they are supported by evidence. When an issue or question is important, critical thinkers support their opinions with evidence: They make arguments.

## Evidence
**Evidence** is a reason offered in support of a claim or conclusion. Evidence takes different forms such as facts, examples, the consensus of individuals with the same opinion, scientific research findings, and statements of an authority or expert.

## Basic Argument
A **basic argument** is a claim or conclusion taken together with evidence supporting it. Find the claim or conclusion and identify whether the statement contains a reason.

### Finding Evidence
Indicator phrases help identify evidence:
* For example
* Because of
* It is known that
Evidence can also be signaled by the citation of a research study, the statement of an authority, or the statement of a fact.

### Weak or Bad Arguments
Sometimes, basic arguments make claims that are untrue. They sometimes use weak or low-quality evidence. Even so, they are basic arguments if they have both a claim or conclusion and at least one piece of supporting evidence. 

### Counterarguments
A **counterargument** is a claim and evidence supporting the other side in an extended argument. It often takes the form of a rebuttal in a dialogue.
* Argument: “The earth is flat; I can see that it continues off into the distance.”
* Counterargument: “The earth is round; this satellite photo shows it is roughly spherical.”

### Inquiry
The purpose of **inquiry** should be to increase our knowledge by reasoning about questions so that we arrive at well-reasoned conclusions. Sometimes people use reasoning strategies and make thinking errors, such as arguing from ignorance, to try to win arguments and not to arrive at truthful conclusions. 	

### Ignorance or Possibility
Arguing from ignorance or possibility is a thinking error in which someone concludes something is true because it may possibly be true or because it is not known to be false. Example: Scientists have not been able to prove that extrasensory perception does not exist; therefore, it probably does exist. 		

## How to Practice CT
If someone offers an opinion with no evidence, a critical thinker will ask for a reason. A critical thinker argues from evidence that exists **and does not argue from ignorance or possibility** (evidence that does not yet exist).
