# Sources of Information

## Research vs Your Experience

Experience has no comparison group.

Experience is confounded.

Research is better than experience.

Research is probabilistic.

### Experience Has No Comparison Group

Compared to what?

Need a comparison group. One reason we should not base our beliefs on personal experience alone is that experience has no comparison group. A comparison group allows us to compare what would occur both with and without whatever it is that interests us (e.g., laundry detergent, soy milk, CDs, Levi's jeans).

### Experience Is Confounded

**Confounds** are alternative explanations

What can we do about confounds?

In the real world, there are usually several possible explanations for an outcome, and these alternative explanations are called confounds. "Confounded" means confused. You think that one thing caused the outcome but because other things also changed, you're confused about what the real cause is.

Example: A study in the newspaper discusses the positive effects of exercise in older adults on their cognitive functioning, but it appeared to have a confound. One group attended a group exercise class during the study, and was told not to exercise. What's the confound? It appears that exercise and social interaction might be confounded. So it's impossible to determine if it was the exercise that caused improvements in cognitive functioning, the social interaction, or perhaps both.
What can we do about confounds? It's difficult to isolate variables in our personal experiences, but in a research setting, scientists are able to change one factor at a time.

## Research Is Better Than Experience

Brad Bushman (2002) conducted a study examining the effect on aggression of venting versus not venting anger. The participants were 600 undergraduates. The researcher needed to invoke anger in the participants, so he asked each undergraduate to write a political essay. Participants were instructed to show their essays to Steve, who was a confederate. He criticized the essays, saying they were the worst he had ever read and making other rude comments.

Undergraduates were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 was told to sit quietly in the room for 2 minutes, Group 2 was told to punch a punching bag for 2 minutes as a form of exercise, and Group 3 was told to punch a punching bag for 2 minutes while imagining Steve's face on the bag (catharsis group). Then participants played a quiz game with Steve, and they were given the opportunity to provide a blast of loud noise to Steve's ears. Which group gave Steve the loudest, longest blasts? Results (Figure 2.4): Group 1 showed less than average levels of aggression, Group 2 showed average levels of aggression, and Group 3 showed greater than average levels of aggression. Note the use of comparison groups and controlling for potential confounds in this study.  

## Claims That Lack Confidence

Claim: **Wearing kinesiotape helps my knee feel better when I run.**

*....but compared to what? *

Is this compared to days not wearing tape? Days you take your run lighter? Days you take advil or tylenol?

## Ways That Intuition Is Biased

Being swayed by a good story

Being persuaded by what easily comes to mind

Failing to think about what we cannot see

Focusing on the evidence we like best 

Being biased about being biased

### Being swayed by a good story

Sometimes we accept a conclusion because it sounds good or it makes sense, even if that good story is false. 

### Being persuaded by what easily comes to mind

The **availability heuristic** states that things that come to mind easily are more "available" to memory and can guide and/or bias our thinking. This is especially true of memories that are recent or vivid.

### Failing to think about what we cannot see

The **present/present bias** states that we notice what is present and thus fail to look for absences. 

### Focusing on the evidence we like best

The tendency to look only at information that agrees with what we already believe is called **confirmation bias**. We "cherry-pick" the information we take in-seeking and accepting only the evidence that supports what we already think.

Example: One study specifically showed how people select only their preferred evidence. The participants took an IQ test and then were told their IQ was either high or low. Shortly afterward, they all had a chance to look at some magazine articles about IQ tests. Those who were told their IQ was low spent more time looking at articles that criticized the validity of IQ tests, whereas those who were told their IQ was high spent more time looking at articles that supported IQ tests as valid measures of intelligence (Frey & Stahlberg, 1986). They all wanted to think they were smart, so they analyzed the available information in biased ways that supported this belief. People keep their beliefs intact (in this case, the belief that they are smart) by selecting only the kinds of evidence they want to see.

## The Intuitive Thinker vs. the Scientific Reasoner

We make mistakes when we base our reasoning on intuition rather than on science.

Researchers create comparison groups and look at all the data.

By thinking scientifically instead of intuitively, we can eliminate or reduce our cognitive and motivational biases. We do this by reasoning systematically and empirically, like researchers do.

Instead of only examining information that comes to mind easily or the parts that sound good, scientists look at all of the data and try to be as objective as possible. 

## Trusting Authorities on the Subject

**Which Authority to Believe?**

Do you trust what authorities tell you to believe? You would want to consider the authority's background and credentials before deciding how reliable she is. You would also want to consider where that authority obtained the information. Is it based on personal experience or intuition, or is it based on scientific evidence?

Example: Jenny McCarthy, an actress and celebrity, claims that giving childhood vaccines later in life than is typically done would prevent autism disorders. Dr. Paul Offit, a physician-scientist who has both reviewed and conducted scientific research on childhood vaccines, says that early vaccines save lives and that there is no link between vaccination and autism diagnosis. While Jenny is a celibrity, she has no credibility in the medical world of autism.

## Finding and Reading the Research

In order to base your beliefs on empirical evidence, you will need to know how to find and read the scientific research:

Consulting scientific sources

Finding scientific sources

Reading the research

Finding research in less scholarly places

## Consulting Scientific Sources
 
### Chapters in edited books

Chapters on a common topic or theme, and each chapter is written by a different author. 
The editor invites authors to contribute to the book, and each chapter usually summarizes a body of research and theory. 
Chapters aren't peer-reviewed with the rigor that journal articles are, but the editor carefully selects the contributors.


### Scientific Databases

**PsycINFO:** PsychINFO is a database and search engine for finding research articles in psychology. It is maintained by the American Psychological Association (APA). It's similar to Google, but it only searches for sources in psychology and related fields. Most articles on PsycINFO are peer-reviewed. You need to have access to a college or university library to use it. You can search by author, title, journal, and so on. My university library has an online tutorial for using PsycINFO, and your school might, too.  

**Google Scholar:** If you want to find empirical research but don't have access to PsycINFO, you can try the free tool Google Scholar. It works like the regular Google search engine, except the search results are only in the form of empirical journal articles and scholarly books.

### TIPS
Use "AND" "OR"

Example, Depression AND adolescent OR teenager

Use * for all possible word endings

* Example: Depres*

## Reading the Research
This is a roadmap for what you will find in an empirical journal article:

Abstract: summary of the article; read it to figure out what the article is about

Introduction: explains the topic of the study, describes the theoretical and empirical background for the research, and states the specific research goals for the current study

Method: how the researchers conducted the study; includes subsections on participants, materials, procedure, and apparatus

Results: describes the statistical tests used and the quantitative or qualitative results of the study

Discussion: summarizes the study and discusses the study's significant contributions and perhaps alternative explanations for their results

References: full bibliographic listing of all the sources the authors cited in the article

## Reading with a Purpose
Empirical journal articles

*What is the argument?* First read the abstract, then skip to the end of the introduction to read about the goals of the current study, then read the rest of the introduction. You might also read the first paragraph of the discussion section.

*What is the evidence to support the argument?* Read the method and results sections.
