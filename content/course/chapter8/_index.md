# CT and the Internet

## Benefits of the Internet
The vast amount of easily accessed information could allow us to make more informed decisions and advance the state of our knowledge. 

Compare it to invention of the printing press, which created a better informed public and had a democratizing effect on society.

## Disadvantages of the Internet
Information overload: Too great a demand on our limited capacity of attention and working memory

Internet addiction disorder

Most of information may be irrelevant: How do we sort through it?

### Information Overload
We have limited resources for paying attention and holding information in short-term memory.

Dual process theory says people use cognitive shortcuts and are biased by what they already know.

They may process information superficially when they receive too much information from digital devices.

### Easy Access to Information Is Not Always Good
The Internet can help you selectively and efficiently access information.

It can also promote confirmation bias, which occurs when people pay attention to only those sites that favor their beliefs and preconceptions.

#### Internet Rumors
Rumors, urban legends, fake news, and conspiracy theories spread rapidly and take on a life of their own. 

An Internet rumor started when an amateur photographer posted a picture of saucer-like object behind the Hale-Bopp comet and Heaven's Gate cult concluded it was evidence of an alien spaceship.

#### Fake News
Fake news is misinformation purporting to be real news.

It is spread on social media and fake websites without any editorial overview or fact checking.

Research at Stanford University conducted by Sam Wineberg suggests that high school and college students are not good at detecting fake news.

## Conspiracy Theory
A conspiracy theory is an alternative account of events offered in place of a conventional understanding of events that proposes the secret collusion of a group to deceive the public.

*Example: Government officials planned and executed the 9/11/01 attack on the World Trade Center, not Osama bin Laden.*

### Conspiracy Theories Can Be False
Usually, when we say something is a conspiracy theory, we mean it is unsubstantiated, or not supported by good evidence, and it is taken to be false.

The conspiracy theory that the moon landing was a hoax is false because the landing is well substantiated by much scientific evidence.

### Some Conspiracies Are Real
Theories about true conspiracies are substantiated, or supported by good evidence, and taken to be true.

For example, Brutus and Roman senators plotting to assassinate Julius Caesar was a real conspiracy. 
*Et Tu, Brute?*

### Pseudoscience and Conspiracy
Theorists say the moon landing must have been faked because the flag was waving, though there could not be wind.

When science offers an explanation, conspiracy theorists are not swayed and show belief perseverance.

### Thinking Errors in Science Related to Conspiracy Theories

Conspiracy theorists misunderstand the inductive nature of science, that we *tentatively* believe what most of the high-quality evidence supports.

Theorists say if 100% of scientists do not believe in a human cause of global warming (the actual percentage is 97%), then it is not true. This is black-and-white thinking, a false dichotomy, all or nothing thinking.

### Assumptions
Conspiracy theorists use assumptions to subvert negative scientific findings after the fact. Post hoc reasoning makes their theories unfalsifiable. 

Their theories are not **parsimonious**-that is, not the simplest theory that can account for the findings. Scientists prefer a parsimonious theory.

### Peer Review
The peer review process involves submitting ideas and research to reviewers who have knowledge and expertise relevant to the research.

Conspiracy theories are not peer reviewed, and they have no standards of evidence and criteria for what makes a study high quality. 

## Web-Based versus Web-Placed
**Web-based:** A "data base," such as PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, or GoogleScholar

**Web-placed:** Someone put or "placed" the information on the Web-often an individual or special-interest group

### Use "CARE" to Evaluate Information on the Internet
| CARE | Meaning |
|-|-|
| **C**redibility | Are sources believable, authentic, and trustworthy?|
| **A**ccuracy | Is the information true, factual, and correct?|
| **R**easonableness | How plausible and consistent are the claims? Are sources objective?|
| **E**vidence | How much good evidence supports and does not support the claims being made? |

#### Testing Credibility of Minds Helping Minds
*Is the author listed, or did a webmaster write the material on the site? *
No author, so we know little about the source. 

*What are the credentials of the author? Ph.D.? Dr.? Special training or qualifications? Relevant biographical information? Does the person/ authority/expert have relevant knowledge?*
We can't tell because no source information was provided.

*Is the author's affiliation provided? Educational institution? Company? Government agency? *
No, because no source information was provided.

*Are there other markers that suggest the source/author is not credible or lacks expertise?* 

* Poor/confusing writing
* Typographic and grammatical errors
* Misuse of technical terminology is shown when the article implies that Einstein was studying psychic energy. 

*How good is the quality control of information provided? *

* Some references to psychanalytical journals, but psychoanalysis has been considered by some to be pseudoscientific. 
* Mentions the International Telepatherapy Association, but it probably does not provide independent corroboration of the information. 


#### Testing Accuracy of Minds Helping Minds
*How recent is the information provided? Dates of research? Last time the site was updated? *
The research cited is old-for example, 1976.
There is no mention of when the site was updated.

*How complete is the information? Are facts omitted? Are all sides of an argument represented by evidence?*

* Only case studies that support telepatherapy are provided. 
* There are only three positive testimonials: Were there others that were not positive?

*Does more than one authority, researcher, or independent person corroborate the factual and other claims made?*  

* No corroboration by actual authorities-only the quote from Einstein, and Einstein's expertise does not seem relevant to telepatherapy. 
* The 1976 article by Dr. David Shainberg describes his personal experience with a telepathic dream as corroboration of telepathy. 


#### Testing Reasonableness of Minds Helping Minds
*Is the information in the website plausible?*

* Telepatherapy does not seem reasonable given what else is known in science and from other authoritative sources. Telepathy has not been reliably supported by scientific research. 
* The term "negative spiritual energies" is not a conventional psychological term and is not connected with psychological science. 

*Is the presentation of information objective or slanted, biased, or designed to arouse your emotions?*
The presentation seems one-sided, with all the evidence and information provided to persuade the reader that telepatherapy is a good therapy.

*Is there a conflict of interest?*

* Probably. It is apparently a business, as signaled by the .com. 
* It charges for instruction: A fee of $149.95 is identified under "Certification."
* The website seems designed to promote a therapy, rather than to evaluate the effectiveness of one.

*Are the claims moderate, or are they extreme?*

* The claim that telepatherapy is "revolutionary" seems extreme, especially given the lack of support for it.
* The claim that telepatherapy "cures" people seems immoderate given that evidence-based practices seldom do this; so, it is inconsistent with what is known in psychological science.

*Is the presentation of information objective or slanted, biased, or designed to arouse your emotions? *
The presentation seems one-sided, and the initial questions are designed to arouse feelings of uncertainty about life.

#### Minds Helping Minds in Sum
Credible? No. Without source information, it is hard to determine credibility, but the website does not seem credible.

Accurate? No. The website contains dated information, as well as typographic and grammar errors.

Reasonable? No. ESP is implausible, and the author has a potential conflict of interest.

Evidence? The claims are supported by low-quality evidence, such as testimonials, statements of authority, and low-quality research.

Based on the website's lack of credibility, inaccuracies, implausible and unreasonable statements, and low-quality evidence, we should conclude that the information on the website is low quality and be very skeptical of claims made about telepatherapy.
