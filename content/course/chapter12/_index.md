# Main Effects & Interactions

**First, watch the below video on main effects and interactions. This video is especially important and helpful for your final project.**

## Experiments with Two Independent Variables Can Show Interactions

An **interaction effect** (also known as interaction) occurs when the effect of one IV depends on the level of another IV. An interaction between two IVs allows researchers to determine whether "it depends."

For example, there is an interaction effect of weather & activity such that going to the beach on a sunny day leads to the highest happiness

## Factorial Designs Study

**Factorial design:** an experiment in which there are two or more IVs. The IVs are also called factors.

### Interpreting Factorial Results: Main Effects and Interactions

**Main effect:** Is there an overall difference?

**IV1**: Main effect of weather, overall REGARDLESS of activity, how happy are people on rainy versus sunny days.

**IV2**: Main effect of Activity, overall REGARDLESS of weather, how happy are people at the beach versus home.

**Interactions** (sunny day/beach leads to the most happy) Is there a difference in differences? More important than main effects.

### Types of Interactions

Crossover interaction: *"it depends"* on both IVs. [Click to See Image Example Here](https://slideplayer.com/slide/3423655/12/images/18/Check+your+work.+This+form+of+interaction+is+a+disordinal.jpg)

Spreading (magnitude) interaction *"Only when"*. [Click to See Image Example Here](https://d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2F0e7%2F0e75916b-7897-4e40-98fc-9e2ecc37222c%2FphpRW2zmc.png)

## Interactions Are More Important Than Main Effects

When a study shows both a main effect and an interaction, the interaction is almost always more important.

There may be real differences in marginal means, but the more exciting part is the interaction.

## Factorial Designs Can Test Theories

Factorial designs can also be used to test theories. Many theories make predictions about how variables might interact with one another. Factorial designs are a good way to test an interaction to see if the results are consistent with your theory.

## Why Worry About All These Interactions?

Most outcomes in psychological studies are not main effects, but rather interactions.

## Writing About Effects

There was a main effect of [IV NAME] such that [LEVEL 1] was higher (MEAN) than [LEVEL 2] (MEAN) on [DV NAME]

There was an interaction effect of [IV1 NAME & IV2 NAME] such that.....depends on the interaction.

## Summary

Interactions can be a tricky topic when first learned about them. For this chapter, I highly recommend watching the zoom recording for this chapter. I go over a detailed example on main effects and interactions. I also recommend watching the video linked at the top of this page. This concept is essential to understand for your final project.
