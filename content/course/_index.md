Welcome to Psych 215, taught in Spring 2021 by Professor Amanda D. Perez. Here you will find all course content (chapter notes & lecture recordings) organized by chapter.

## Course Overview

This course is an introduction to the methods psychologists
use to understand human behavior. The course examines the scientific method, operationalization of variables, inductive and deductive reasoning, experimental and non-experimental designs (including descriptive methods), experimental instrumentation, group and single-subject designs, and research ethics. Research in a variety of subfields within psychology will be utilized to demonstrate research design and the collection, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of research data. Students will perform a literature review, design an original research study, and prepare research reports using American Psychological Association (APA) style report writing.

## Grade Details
Your grade in the class will be based on the following (a summary of these components follows). Final grades will not be curved; letter grades will be based on rounded cutoffs (A > 89 > B > 79 > C > 69 > F). 

<b> Exams </b>
<ul>
  <li> 25 points Highest Scoring Exam </li>
  <li> 20 points Middle Scoring Exam </li>
  <li> 15 points Lowest Scoring Exma </li>
  </ul>
  
<b> Video Responses (9 points, 3 each) </b>

<b> Final Project (45 points) </b>

<b> Peer Review Check-in 1 (10 points, 5 each) </b>

<b> Chapter Quizzes (55 points, 5 each (lowest dropped))</b>

### Exams
There will be a total of 2 Exams administered via canvas quizzes. They will be based on material from lectures and readings and will consist of multiple choice questions and occasionally some short answers. The exams are not cumulative and will only cover new untested material. I have a strong belief in rewarding growth and improvement. Therefore, your 2 exams will be weighted such that your higher scoring exam will be worth more. Exams are open-notes, open-book, and un-timed. 


### Videos
I have selected 3 videos to accompany 3 weeks.  You are to watch the videos and submit a response (few sentences) on Canvas assignments.

### Final Project
At the end of the course, you will complete a research paper that proposes a study and predicts and reports the results you might find. We will work on this project throughout the semester. Check-in 1 is worth 10 points, Check-in 2 is worth 15 points, and the Final Project is worth 20 points. See the  <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VzuaKzrilPiy97XnqOnUAaaJwHZZp2-rKAM3NqI2DIQ/edit?usp=sharing"> rubruc and example project </a>  for more detail.


## Course Policies

<b>Student Contact and Canvas</b> Student Contact and Canvas. I will regularly send announcements through Canvas. It is your responsibility to regularly check Canvas for announcements and assignments.

<b>Late Work.</b> Late work is accepted with a 10% penalty. If it is more than 48 hours late, additional penalties will apply.


<b>Academic Integrity.</b> Do NOT cheat. Do NOT plagiarize. To copy text or ideas from another source is plagiarism. Anyone caught cheating or plagiarizing will receive a zero for the assignment, and I will submit a Report of Academic Dishonesty to the college. For more information, read the DVC Procedure 4001.04 Academic Dishonesty policy (on Canvas).

<b>Strategies for success.</b> Do your readings, complete assignments on time, understand how the topics and information relate to what you’ve learned (and are learning), and if you don’t understand something, please ask the question! If you stop attending lecture and / or turning in assignments and do not respond to e-mail, I will drop you from the class to avoid giving you an F.

<b>Most important.</b> Let me know as soon as anything in your life starts to interfere with your ability to do well in this class (e.g. sickness, work/housing/family issues, mental health crisis, etc.), so I can work with you on a plan to succeed. There’s more I can do earlier in the semester than at the end.

In addition to the many student clubs DVC offers, DVC also offers three college access and success programs - Puente, Umoja, and Mesa. Learn more at the PUMA Center on campus |  www.dvc.edu/current/learning-community/puma/

<b>Undocumented Students:</b> I believe that all people deserve access to education, and serve the college as an ally to undocumented students. The DVC Dreamers Alliance has organized resources to support undocumented students, protect their rights, and offer potential financial aid | www.dvc.edu/student-services/dvc-dreamers/

<b>Students with Disabilities:</b> Students who require support or adaptive equipment because of a specific disability -- or would like to be tested to see if they qualify for a learning, auditory, or visual disability -- can request these services through the Disability Support Services (DSS) office.
