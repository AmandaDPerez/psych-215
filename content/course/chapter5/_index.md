# Identifying Good Measurement

## Ways to Measure Variables

**First Important Decision:** *how a variable should be operationalized*

Any variable can be expressed in two ways: as a **conceptual variable** (aka construct or theoretical level) and as an **operational variable (how the variable** will be measured or manipulated). 

### Example: Ed Diener & Happiness

* Started by creating a conceptual definition of happiness: "subjective well-being" (a person's own perception of his or her well-being). 

* Then, Diener came up with an operational definition by asking participants to respond to 5 items about their life satisfaction on a 7-point scale with 1 = "strongly disagree" and 7 = "strongly agree." 

### Operationalizing other conceptual variables: 
To study conceptual variables other than happiness, you would follow a similar procedure: 

(1) Define your construct (i.e., the conceptual variable)

(2) Create an operational definition for your construct.

## Three Common Types of Measures

(1) **Self-report measures**: Recording people's answers to questions about themselves in a questionnaire or interview; for example, operationalizing caffeine consumption by asking, *"How many caffeinated beverages have you consumed today?"*

(2) **Observational measures**: (aka behavioral measures) Recording observable behaviors; for example, operationalizing allergies by *observing how often someone sneezes*


(3) **Physiological measures**: Recording biological data (e.g., brain activity, hormonal levels, heart rate); for example, operationalizing whether someone can distinguish between two different speech sounds by *examining his or her brain responses to those speech sounds*

### Which is Best?

A single construct can be operationalized in all three ways

One way is not necessarily better than another

It's preferable that the three types of measures show similar patterns of results

## Scales of Measurement

All variables must have at least two levels to allow for change (so they can vary)
The levels of operational variables can be coded using different scales of measurement:

(1) Categorical Variables

(2) Quantitative Variables

### Categorical Variables

**Their levels are qualitatively distinct categories**

Also referred to as nominal variables.

For example: species (rhesus macaque, bonobo, chimpanzee), Food (Veg, Fruit, Other), Prof's DVC Classes (PSYCH 145, PSYCH 215)

### Quantitative Variables

**Variables coded with meaningful numbers**

for example, height, weight, or scale of subjective well-being.

There are three types of quantitative variables: *Ordinal scale, Interval scale, Ratio scale*

#### Ordinal

Ranked order 

Ex: first, second, third places in a race

* First place isn't twice as fast as second place

#### Interval

Numerals represent equal distances between levels and there is no true zero (zero does not mean "nothing")

for example, IQ score (a score of 160 is twice as large as a score of 80)

Diener's 1-7 scale, 0 = NOT MEANINGFUL

#### Ratio

Numerals represent equal intervals and there is a true zero

for example, height or exam scores

## Reliability
How *consistent* the results of a measure are

Three types: test-retest, interrater, internal

### Test/Retest

Consistent scores every time the measure is used

For example, give an IQ test at Time 1 (T1), at the beginning of the semester, and again at Time 2 (T2), at the end of the semester. The scores should be relatively consistent across the two times.

* Reliable at 2 time points

### Interrater

Consistent scores no matter who does the measuring

for example, two observers measure how often a child smiles during one hour at a daycare playground, and their counts are consistent with one another

Ex: Watch The Office Fire scene & get consistent counts of "Fear"

### Internal

Internal consistency. A participant provides a consistent pattern of responses, regardless of how the researcher has phrased the question

For example, a researcher asks in several different ways about how lonely you feel, and your responses are consistent with one another

## Reliability DOES NOT EQUAL Validity

Reliability is not the same as validity

Reliability is possible without Validity

* Ex: head circumference as an operationalization for intelligence. Head circumference is a reliable measure, but it is not a valid measure of intelligence

Validity is **NOT POSSIBLE** without Reliability

* If findings are not consistent, you are not measuring what you are intending to measure

## Face Validity and Content Validity

*Does It Look Like a Good Measure?*

Both face validity and content validity are subjective ways to assess validity

**Face validity**: It looks like what you want to measure

**Content validity**: The measure contains all the parts that your theory says it should contain

## Criterion Validity

*Does It Correlate with Key Behaviors?*

Most psychological scientists prefer to rely on empirical assessments of validity over subjective judgments

One way to empirically assess validity is by examining **criterion validity**: whether the measure is related to a concrete outcome that it should be related to

Practice SAT & Actual SAT performance

## Convergent Validity and Discriminant Validity

*Does the Pattern Make Sense?*

**Convergent validity**: A measure should correlate strongly with other measures of the same construction; similarity

* Happiness & Life Satisfaction

**Discriminant validity** (aka divergent validity): A measure should correlate less strongly with measures of different constructs; in other words, there must be differences

* Happiness & Stress
