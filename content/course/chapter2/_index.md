## Deductive Reasoning, Prediction, and Assumptions

Two Kinds of Reasoning:

* Inductive reasoning (induction)
* Deductive reasoning (deduction)

Essential to distinguish between these two reasoning tools because they have different uses an rules, which allow different degrees of certainty in our conclusions.

## Inductive Reasoning
Reasoning from specific cases to a general principle

We use inductive reasoning to **generalize** from specific bits of evidence to general conclusion

*Example: Psychologists generalize from research results to justify that some theory or hypothesis is true*

### Scientific Use of Inductive Reasoning

Using inductive reasoning, Pierre Paul Broca **generalized from individual cases** of brain damage, **to the conclusion that damage to a specific area in the left frontal lobe of the brain would impair speech production**.

#### Inductive Reasoning in Action
Generalizing from the cases of people with speech production problems who also have damage to Broca's area leads to the **inductive conclusion that damage to Broca's area is associated with impaired speech production**.

These bits of evidence justify this inductive conclusion and theory. 

## Deductive Reasoning

Often proceeds in the other direction as inductive reasoning, from general principles to specifics.  

Uses of Deductive Reasoning:  

* Making predictions about the outcomes of research
* Reasoning from a definition to an example
* Reasoning from a law to a specific case


## How to Form a Conditional Argument 

### Major Premise
The **major premise** is a statement of the general theory.

The **antecedent** goes first: "If . . ."

The **consequent** follows: "then . . ."

### Minor Premise

The **minor premise** asserts the antecedent in specific terms.

The conclusion is the consequent expressed in specific terms. 

### Conditional Argument: Broca's Theory

|  | Antecedent | Consequent |
|-|-|-|
| **Major Premise** | If Broca's area is damaged... | then speech production will be impaired. |
| **Minor Premise** | Broca's area in Bill's brain has been damaged. |  |
| *Conclusion* |  | Therefore, Bill's speech will be impaired. |

## A Sound Argument

An argument must follow the correct, logical form to be valid.

All of the premises must be true for the conclusion to be true.

### How to Create a Sound Argument

To create a sound argument, you must assert the antecedent. 

The previous example in the table asserts the antecedent (**minor premise**): Broca's area in Bill's brain has been damaged.

Therefore, the argument is valid.

## Using Deductions to Predict Outcomes

We can use conditional deductive reasoning to make scientific predictions from a theory. 

The antecedent predicts the consequent when you use the valid (correct) logical form of asserting the antecedent. 

We can use social learning theory as an example to deduce a prediction.

### Social Learning Theory

When people observe another person model a behavior, then those observing the behavior are more likely to engage in that behavior than those not observing it.

One example of testing the social learning theory is the Bobo doll experiment. 

#### Bandura & Walters (1959) Social Learning Theory of Aggression

**Method:** One group of preschool children observed an adult behaving aggressively toward a "Bobo" doll. A second group observed the adult in the room not behaving aggressively.

**Finding:** When the children were put in the room with the doll, those who observed the adult behaving aggressively imitated the aggression and behaved more aggressively toward the doll.

### Deducing a Prediction

**If** a group of children observes an adult behave aggressively toward a Bobo doll and another (control) group does not observe an aggressive model a behavior....

**then** the group observing the aggressive model will be more likely to engage in aggressive behavior than the control group.

### Implications of Social Learning Theory

Children observing violence in the media (TV, movies, video games) may be more likely to subsequently engage in aggressive behavior.

Copy-cat crimes may be committed by those who hear about violent acts through the media.

### Drive Theory of Aggression
The drive toward aggression is reduced when people observe aggressive acts, such as aggressive sporting events, because this releases dangerous levels of aggression that are building up.

Drive theory resembles the commonsense idea that if people vent they will show less anger and aggression.

### Social Learning Theory vs. Drive Theory
Almost all studies support social learning theory, including many studies on children watching violent TV and some studies of people playing violent video games.

In one study that directly compared them, social learning theory was supported.

Studies did not support the idea of venting or "blowing off steam," which goes against drive theory (Bushman, Baumeister, & Stack; Tavris, 1988).

## Deductive Fallacy
A thinking error produced by not following the correct logical form, which is to assert the antecedent (**minor premise**)

Deductive fallacies, such as asserting the consequent, lead to conclusions that do not necessarily follow the premises

### Asserting the Consequent
The following example below is **incorrect** because it asserts the consequent in the minor premise (instead of the antecedent)


|  | Antecedent | Consequent |
|-|-|-|
| **Major Premise** | If Broca's area is damaged... | then speech production will be impaired. |
| **Minor Premise** |  |  Bill's speech is impaired (*Consequent is asserted*)|
| *Conclusion* | Therefore, Bill's speech will be impaired. |  |

This is invalid because the consequent has been asserted. Maybe Bill has a speech impediment. 

## Belief Bias
**Belief bias** occurs when a person's prior knowledge or belief interferes with drawing a valid or sound conclusion. 

## Improving Theories
In true science, theories, such as social learning theory, improve.

**Social cognitive learning theories**, newer theories incorporating cognitive factors, can more fully explain aggression.

Objects such as guns, in combination with aggressive thoughts, can signal aggression through **priming**-making aggressive thoughts and impulses more accessible

## Assumptions
An **assumption** is an unstated premise that is taken for granted in an argument. 

*Example: If someone is nice to other people, then that person will be liked. Taylor is liked by many people.*

The assumption is that Taylor is nice. Notice that the consequent has been asserted. The argument becomes valid if the missing premise "Taylor is nice" is asserted and then the conclusion follows.

### Unwarranted Assumptions
When an assumption is **unwarranted**, it is not justified or supported by a good reason and it is taken for granted or hidden. 

An unwarranted assumption is a kind of argumentation/thinking error, and it can lead to a wrong conclusion.

Your textbook's author suspected that college football players were not good students, a stereotype that he found was an *unwarranted assumption* when he was surprised to learn that one of his best students played varsity football all through college. 

#### Finding Unwarranted Assumptions
Find assumptions (often missing premises) and make them explicit. 

Look for any evidence supporting each assumption. 

An unwarranted assumption is not supported by good reasons. 

## Arguing from a Perspective
Psychologists make assumptions when they argue from a perspective. 

* Cognitive psychologists assume that people process information in some ways similar to how a computer processes information.
* Social psychologists assume that the behaviors and expectations of other people influence an individual's own behavior.

## Shifting the Burden of Proof and Arguing from Ignorance/Possibility
**Shifting the burden of truth** occurs when one argues against a theory by saying that there is no evidence against a contested theory, so the contested theory must be true. 
In reality, the responsibility for supporting a claim lies with the person making the claim. 

### Shifting the Burden of Proof 
For example, creationists argue that scientists have not proved that creationist science is not true; therefore, it is likely true because otherwise they would have shown it to be false. 

However, the burden of proof is on creationists to support their theory with actual evidence. 

## Circular Reasoning
**Circular reasoning** occurs when a form of the conclusion of an argument is offered as a premise of the argument.

*Example: Donald J. Trump at his news conference of February 16, 2017, stated, "The news is fake because so much of the news is fake."*

Even though there is a "because" in this argument, the reason it offers is the same as the conclusion, so it is a circular argument.
