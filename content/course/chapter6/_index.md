# Errors in Attention, Perception, and Memory That Affect Thinking

## Cognitive Errors Affect Thinking
**Cognitive errors** are errors that occur in processing as we attend, perceive, learn, remember, and think. We focus on the errors that can affect thinking.
 
Reasoning is a cognitive activity that depends on attention, perception, and memory. Problems with these cognitive processes lead to thinking errors.

### Cognitive Errors Can Have Big Consequences
Each year, hundreds of people are wrongly convicted of crimes based on faulty eyewitness testimony and identification. 

Jurors often place a high value on eyewitness memories that are confidently, but inaccurately reported, leading jurors to make faulty judgments. 

### When Do Cognitive Errors Occur?
**Attention:** when we focus on something

**Memory:** when we learn and remember 

**Perception:** when sensory information is organized and interpreted

### Attention
Our ability to direct our minds to new stimuli, focus on these stimuli, and maintain our alertness and awareness of stimuli and our mental contents

Basic assumption: Our attention is limited.

#### Inattentional Blindness
Paying attention to one part of a display can lead us to miss something that is clearly visible in our field of view.

Mack and Rock (1998) have argued that we may be unaware of what we are perceiving unless we attend to it.

#### Magicians Misdirect Attention
Magicians use inattentional blindness by showing an object and then directing attention elsewhere. 

* When you switch your attention back to the object, it is gone. 

#### Change Blindness Blindness 
Levin, Momen, Drivdahl, and Simons (2000) asked subjects if they would notice changes that happened in front of them. 

Participants greatly overestimated their ability to detect such changes; this is a kind of overconfidence and a metacognitive problem. Participants were blind to their change blindness.

#### Divided Attention (Multitasking) 
Distributing your attentional resources between more than one task is less efficient and more prone to error than when you focus on one task.

*Example: Talking on the cell phone or texting while driving involves divided attention and greatly increases driving errors and the risk of an accident compared to just focusing on driving.*

### Working Memory
Working memory: the kind of short-term memory we use to do tasks in which we must hold information temporarily in memory as we do some mental work. 

Examples: solving problems, reading, critical thinking, comprehending and taking notes in class

#### Working Memory Is Limited
It can hold about 5-9 items at once.

It holds information for short periods of time unless we pay attention to the information or refresh it using rehearsal.

Interference from other information may lead us to forget or mix up the information we are holding in working memory. 

#### Working Memory Errors 
When **cognitive load** is too great (when we must hold or process too much data at once), we may forget information that we need to do a task, or our performance may become unorganized. 

For example, when you are taking notes, you may not be able to remember some new information while still writing down what you heard before. 

### Long-Term Memory
Long-term memory is the memory for the vast amount of information we accumulate throughout our lives, including facts, memories of experiences, knowledge of language, and how to do things.

Long-term memory is subject to error, as when an eyewitness misidentifies a person in a lineup or you forget an answer on a test. 

### Memory Errors
**False memories**, also called "memory illusions," occur when you remember things that were not there.

**Source forgetting** is forgetting where or how you obtained some information-that is, attributing your memory to the wrong source or person.

#### Ordinary Memory Can Be Accurate
People can recognize 40,000 different words and 93% of 2,560 pictures viewed 3 days earlier.

They can greatly improve their memories and accuracy of recall by using mnemonics and correct practice.

Actors can learn to accurately recall hundreds of lines.

### Accurate Eyewitness Testimony
Yuille and Cutsall (1986) did a scientific study and tested the memory of 13 eyewitnesses; they found memory to be accurate 5 months after an event.

Odinot, Walters, and van Koppen (2009) did a case study on the memory of 13 eyewitnesses and found it to be 84% accurate 3 months after an event.



### Inaccurate Eyewitness Testimony 
Loftus and Palmer (1974) found that providing misinformation after witnessing an incident affects estimates. 

Example: People who got a leading question-How fast was the car going when it 'crashed into' versus 'contacted' the other car?-estimated higher speeds in the "crashed" case. 

Belli (1989), Loftus et al. (1989), and Sutherland and Hayne (2001) conducted experiments verifying the misinformation effect.

#### Misinformation Effect
The misinformation effect involves a witness hearing misleading information after viewing an event that produces biased or inaccurate memories. 

The misinformation effect results from reconstruction around prior knowledge or a schema related to the information. 

### Eyewitness Identification
Involves recognition of what a person looks like

* Face
* Body
* Clothing
* Voice

People believe that eyewitness identification is accurate because:

* Humans are good at recognizing facial expressions that depict basic emotions.
* Everyday experience shows we seldom fail to recognize the faces of people we know.

However, an eyewitness must recognize people based on facial features, not from the emotion in the face.

Also, In eyewitness memory, we are often asked to remember an unfamiliar face. 

A scientific study by Valentine et al. (2003) of 314 actual lineups from London police records revealed low levels of identification accuracy.

Of 640 eyewitnesses, only 40% were able to identify the perpetrator. 

Most of the high-quality evidence suggests that eyewitness testimony is often inaccurate, and is susceptible to suggestion, leading questions, and inaccurate reconstruction.

Likewise, most of the high-quality evidence suggests that eyewitness identification is often inaccurate.

**Therefore, eyewitness memory is often inaccurate.**

### Is Memory Inaccurate?
Sometimes, under certain conditions.

Be careful not to make a **sweeping generalization** about the accuracy of memory, in general, from the specific discussion suggesting that eyewitness memory is often inaccurate.


### Perception
Perception involves taking in data through the senses and then organizing the data, finding patterns in it, and interpreting it.

Perception usually leads to awareness of something in the environment.

#### Sensory Perceptual Limitations
We have severe limits on the energy changes we can detect with our unaided senses. 

Dogs and bats can hear higher-frequency sounds than can humans.

Humans have been able to artificially enhance and supplement their sensory abilities to overcome these limitations. 

#### Expectations Can Bias Perception
Studies have shown that background knowledge and expectations can bias perception rather than improve it. 

A study by Thorne and Himelstein (1984) tested this idea by telling one group of people that there were satanic words in a rock song played backward. A control group, given no background knowledge, heard no such words. The other group reported many.

#### Hallucinations
A **hallucination** is a type of cognitive error in which a person perceives something with no real, objective stimulus present. 

Information stored in memory is likely being retrieved and constructed into experiences that seem real.

One common, normal hallucination is hearing someone calling your name when no one really is. 

##### Types of Hallucinations
People with schizophrenia may have auditory hallucinations that are connected to recurring, paranoid delusions.

Grieving people sometimes hallucinate the image of the departed-this can be normal during early grieving.

#### Sensed Presence
**Sensed presence** is hallucinating the image of a person, especially under physically demanding and stressful conditions.

Charles Lindbergh, the first person to fly nonstop across the Atlantic, came to believe, after hours of sleep deprivation, that there was a presence in his plane guiding him to his destination.
