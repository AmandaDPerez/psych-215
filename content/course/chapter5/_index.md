## Pseudoscience: Why Study It?
**Pseudoscience** makes false claims and masquerades as real science.

Pseudoscience can have dangerous outcomes.

### Pseudoscience Is Dangerous
In 2000, Candace Newmaker was having trouble adjusting to her adoptive mother; she was having behavioral problems.

Two unlicensed social workers, Julie Ponder and Connell Watkins, treated Candace with attachment therapy. 

The Outcome: Candace was forced to try to slide through a blanket wrapped around her to simulate birth. She cried, vomited, urinated, and said she couldn't breathe. After about an hour of this ordeal, she died of suffocation. 

#### Attachment Therapy Assumptions
Candice's caregivers believed that having her go through a simulation of the birthing process would attach her to her new caregiver.

These are *unwarranted assumptions*, ones not supported by evidence.

#### What Are the Ethical Implications?
The APA ethical guidelines say psychologists should do no harm.

They should use practices that are effective and not use pseudoscientific and ineffective ones.

#### Attachment Therapy as Thinking Error
People who believe in attachment therapy are inappropriately using reasoning by representativeness or *"like goes with like."*

They think that a person who is not attached should go through something that looks like birthing to become attached.

#### Attachment Therapy Is Pseudoscience
**"Pseudo"** means false: It looks like science, but it is not really science.

Pseudoscientific practices do not follow the rules of good science.

Scientific research has not shown attachment therapy to be effective, but its practitioners still claim it is.

## Why Did the Romans See Libra?
[Romans saw Libra in the stars](https://www.space.com/21597-libra-constellation.html). 

Their culture probably influenced what they saw from their myths.

Libras are thought to be balanced, intelligent, and diplomatic, but gullible and indecisive.

Psychologically, the identification of Libra shows **pareidolia:** the influence of knowledge and expectation on perception.

## Assumptions of Astrology
The pattern of stars corresponding to the time of your birth determines the traits you have and the course of your life. 

Astrologers can use this information to make predictions about your life and offer guidance. 

The astrological predictions in horoscopes are so general that they would be hard to test objectively in a specific context.

The general predictions in horoscopes could be easily explained away when they fail.

Example Horoscope:
*It is important to you that people like you and that they admire you for who you are. Sometimes, though, you tend to be more critical of yourself than other people are. While people may perceive you as confident of yourself on the outside, on the inside you are somewhat insecure. At times, you try very hard to reach your goals, but you have much unused potential. Changes and events are coming up in the near future that will present unique opportunities for you. Because of your personality characteristics, it is important that you watch for these opportunities so that you will not miss them. *

### Barnum Effect
People tend to accept general personality descriptions, but they are not predictive. 

This uncritical tendency of people to accept general descriptions that do not really describe them has been termed the **"Barnum effect"** after the circus entrepreneur's expression, "We've got something for everyone" (Meehl, 1956).

### Checking Outcomes
Astrologers do not systematically check the outcomes of their predictions.

Astrologers tend to pay more attention to evidence supporting their predictions, while ignoring their failures.

### General Rules of Reasoning
Astrologers incorrectly use general rules of reasoning to evaluate claims and hypotheses. 

They often use logical criteria inappropriately, such as when they say, *"Science has not been able to disprove astrology,"* to reverse the burden of proof.

They fail to reject their theory when scientific research has not supported astrological predictions.

## Implausible Claims
**Scientific plausibility** is how *reasonable* we judge a claim to be, given other things we know in science.

### Obscure Terminology
Astrologers use obscure terms, such as "sun signs," "the seventh house," "horoscopes," and "zodiac."

Astronomers, physicists, psychologists, and other scientists do not use these terms in their theories.

### Could physics or astronomy explain astrology?
Is there something special about the light from certain stars, planets, and the moon that might affect the human body at the time of one's birth?

**No**, light is light. The light from one star or planet at a particular time is not much different from other patterns of light.

**Astrology is implausible**

## Alchemy
**Alchemy** is a mystical approach to combining substances or transmuting them into gold.

Since alchemists discovered many principles that later informed chemistry, it can be considered a "proto-science."

## Mesmerism
**Mesmerism** resembles the modern technique of hypnosis. 

Mesmer would tell patients that he had magnetized water, and some patients fainted.

Through an investigation on mesmerism, some scientific principles were first developed.

### Investigation of Mesmerism
**Placebo control:** Researchers told subjects they had magnetized water through mesmerism but they hadn't; even so, people said they felt the effects. 

**Blind testing:** Without telling subjects, researcher magnetized some water samples but not others; subjects could not tell which was which. 

## Modern Pseudoscience 
Modern science is often highly technical and requires an understanding of technology. 

Pseudoscience goes through the motions of scientific practices without the technology of science. 

## Parapsychology
**Paranormal** refers to phenomena that seem to defy scientific explanation.

**Parapsychology** is the supposedly scientific study of the paranormal.

### Parapsychology as Pseudoscience
Psychic predictions are vague and general. Often, they are supported by low-quality evidence such as personal experience and anecdotes. 

Post hoc explanations try to explain away negative findings. This strategy makes parapsychology unfalsifiable. 

Some believers engage in reversing the burden of proof, and arguing from possibility.

Many studies have failed to support the existence of ESP, but many parapsychologists continue to believe in it anyway.

Parapsychology is inconsistent with physics and scientific study of perception.

It is often supported by low-quality evidence and not supported by high-quality scientific research. 

## Evidence-Based Treatments
**Evidence-based treatments (EBTs)** are treatments for psychological problems whose effectiveness is validated through high-quality scientific research. 
Behaviorism took a careful, systematic, often experimental approach to observing and modifying behavior, and in developing effective treatments such as systematic desensitization to treat phobias.

### Scientist-Practitioner Model
**Scientist-practitioner:** Clinicians should be good scientists. 

They should be trained to think like a scientist and engage in scientific practices.

### Efficacy Research
**Efficacy research:** Clinicians should do high-quality research to discover which psychotherapies are the most effective for treating a problem. Then clinicians should use these effective therapies.

### Randomized-Trial Experiment
Experimenters randomly assign clients with a certain psychological disorder to an experimental therapy and a control condition. 

Comparing the two groups, experimenters can see that the observed effect was due to the treatment. 

### Placebos
**Placebo control group:** People receive something that looks like a real therapy to control for the expectancy of getting a treatment.

**Placebo effect:** People report feeling better when they receive what looks like real treatment. 

### Wait List 
**Wait list control group:** Participants are told they need to wait to get a treatment. At the same time as the treatment group, the wait list control group is tested before and after therapy.

This controls for spontaneous remission, or patients getting better because time has passed without treatment.

## Is Freudian Psychoanalysis Pseudoscientific?
Adler showed that Freud's ideas were not falsifiable. Also, the theory of the unconscious motives is hard to test.

Freud was very resistant to criticism of his theory and may have shown a confirmatory bias in interpreting dreams and cases.

Freudian psychoanalysis has not been revised, though it has been shown to be less effective than other approaches. 

Freud used low-quality evidence such as case studies of poor quality. Very little experimentation was done on the effectiveness of psychoanalysis.

## Scientology
Though it pretends to be scientific, Scientology does not systematically test the outcomes of its predictions.

It lacks connection to other sciences.

It is implausible; Scientology is based on science fiction myths.

Scientology is supported by low-quality evidence such as poorly documented cases and statements of celebrities, such as Tom Cruise, who know little about science.

Scientology uses unconventional terms, such as referring to counselors as "auditors."

## Power Therapies
**Thought Field Therapy** claims that tapping at specific points on the head can release blocked energy that causes psychological problems.

It boasts a very high success rate for many different kinds of disorders.

It claims it can be effective in just one or two treatment sessions.

These claims make it implausible.

## Self-Help Books
A market survey showed that the people who were most likely to buy a self-help book were the people who had bought such a book in the last 18 months.

There is not much research about self-help, and the research results that do exist are mixed.

For these reasons, it is impossible to tell if self-help books are actually helpful. 

### Positive Thinking
Many self-help techniques were created around positive thinking. 

One such approach, *The Secret*, claimed that life is governed by the **law of attraction**, meaning that people who think positive thoughts will attract positive outcomes. 

#### The Secret
James Arthur Ray, a proponent of The Secret, had followers go through a sweat lodge ceremony to help them avoid fear of death.

One such ceremony resulted in 18 people being hospitalized and 3 people dying from being denied water. Ray was convicted of three counts of negligent homicide.

## Alternative Medicine
**Alternative medicine** uses natural remedies that have been unchanged for centuries.

It is mostly untested in a rigorous fashion and unregulated in the United States. 

These medicines often claim to be clinically proven, but have been only minimally tested.

## Magnet Therapy
One alternative medicine, known as **magnet therapy**, claims that magnets placed near the body can reduce pain, promote well-being, and even cure cancer.

Research has shown that magnets on the body have no effect. 

Experiments comparing magnet treatments to placebos have not shown that the magnets have clear benefits.
