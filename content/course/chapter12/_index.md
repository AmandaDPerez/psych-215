# Superstition & Magic
## What Is a Superstition?
A superstition is a type of commonsense or folk belief that is not plausible and false.

A superstitious behavior often involves engaging in some ritual action that is intended to prevent an undesirable outcome or increase one's luck, but that does not actually affect the objective probability of success.

## Superstitions, Misconceptions, and Pseudoscience 
All three make unsubstantiated claims.

A superstition resembles a pseudoscientific belief in that both are implausible, given what is known from science. 

An important difference from pseudoscience is that people do not claim that a superstition is based on science, as do believers in pseudoscience.

## Superstition and Magic
Superstition has long been associated with magic.

Those who believe in and practice magic often assume that certain practices, rituals, and potions can harness supernatural forces to achieve impossible feats and control the forces of nature. 

## Superstition Persists
The idea of witchcraft is found in the *Hebrew Bible, the New Testament*, and *The Odyssey of Homer*.

During the Inquisition in Europe, many people, especially women, were accused of witchcraft. 

Belief in witches persists in the twenty-first century, despite the "triumph" of modern science.

## Rise of Science in the Sixteenth through Nineteenth Centuries
Science gave natural explanations for events previously given supernatural explanations. *Witches do not cause diseases; germs do.*

With the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution in the 1600s, increasingly scientific-minded people criticized superstition as unscientific, folk belief.

### Law of Similarity
Things that resemble each other share important properties, as in "like goes with like" 

*Example: The Voodoo practice of burning a doll that looks like the intended victim to harm the person.*

###  Law of Contagion
Once things come into contact with each other, they may change each other for a period of time.

*Example: A person does not want to handle an object that belonged to an evil person for fear of being harmed or corrupted by the evil person. *

## The Psychology of Superstition
We should try to scientifically understand the behavior and mental processes of people who believe in superstition because it is so pervasive.

Which factors are contributing to superstitious belief, thinking, and behavior?

### A Modern Example
The legendary baseball hitter Wade Boggs ate chicken before every game for 20 years. As part of his 5-hour, ritualized pregame preparation, he finished a drill by stepping on third base, then second, then first, and took two steps toward the coaching box and exactly four steps to the dugout. Each time before batting, he drew the Hebrew letter chai in the dirt with the tip of his bat (Vyse, 1997). 

Boggs reported that he did this so as *not to leave anything to chance.*

## What Leads to Superstition?
Coincidental events are likely to happen over the long run but at low frequencies. 

When coincidences inevitably happen, people, in their search for patterns, seem prone to attribute them to paranormal or supernatural causes, especially when they happen to them.

### Motivational-Emotional Perspective
Perhaps, engaging in superstitious behaviors:

* Reduces negative emotion and stress
* Helps motivate a person to stay on task
* Increases hope for a positive outcome 
* Helps offer compensatory control over anxiety-provoking randomness

### Superstitious Rituals May Help Some People Cope 

People who routinely engage in risky, high- stakes activities, such as athletes, gamblers, and fighter pilots, are particularly susceptible to superstitious behaviors. 

*Example: Wade Boggs and his pregame rituals*

## Learning Theory Perspective
According to learning theory, behaviors that are rewarded tend to be reinforced and increase in frequency. 

A behavior that was coincidentally followed by a rewarding stimulus might be reinforced even though it did not actually predict the reward. 

### Superstition in Pigeons
When B.F. Skinner placed pigeons in operant chambers and food was dispensed randomly during 15-second intervals, the pigeons were reinforced for whatever behavior they were engaging in before reinforcement.

The pigeons acquired superstitious (i.e., very unusual) behaviors such as repeatedly bobbing their heads and walking in circles that were not predictive of obtaining the food reward. 

#### People Acquiring Superstitions
Skinner's finding that pigeons can acquire superstitious behaviors through operant conditioning has been replicated with children and college students.

Superstitious practices can be acquired as individuals learn (incorrectly) through operant conditioning that a ritual behavior predicts reward or success.

### Superstitious Objects
Lucky objects are used to improve the chance of success in risky activities. This effect may potentially occur through reinforcement.

About one-third of college students use lucky pens or wear lucky clothing when taking a test.

## Superstition and Thinking Errors
*Post hoc, ergo propter hoc:* "After this, therefore because of this" reasoning may lead to superstitious rituals. 

Examples: Perhaps after he got hits and his team won when he did his rituals, Wade Boggs mistakenly concluded that the rituals were leading to the wins. As a professional basketball player, Michael Jordan wore undershorts that were associated with his earlier successes in college basketball.

## Law of Contagion
Law of contagion: A psychological phenomenon underlying feelings of contamination and superstitious behaviors.

The entity can be some unobservable property or force (either positive or negative) associated with a person or object that can be transmitted to a person.

### Would You Wear the Sweater of a Convicted Killer?
Research by Nemeroff and Rozin (1990) asked participants if they would wear a sweater worn by someone who had lost a limb or worn by someone else who was a convicted killer. 

Participants were reluctant to do so.

This demonstrates the law of contagion. 

### Real-World Negative Consequences of the Law of Contagion
Many people are unwilling to have any contact with a person who has AIDS or any objects associated with such a person, even though AIDS is not easily transmitted except through exchange of bodily fluids.

This can result in AIDs victims being needlessly shunned.

## Apparent Mental Causation
Definition: Believing that merely having a thought, without the intervention of a behavior or physical factor, can affect another person or influence an event.

Participants in a study who were instructed to form positive visualizations of a peer's successful basketball shooting believed that they had influenced the peer.

### Apparent Mental Causation Is a Paranormal Belief
It is akin to:

* Telepathy (mentally influencing a mind at a distance)
* Telekinesis (mentally influencing an object at a distance)

## Could the Law of Contagion Have an Evolutionary Basis?
Even if you did not know about germ theory, staying away from a sick person would be adaptive, increasing the survival rate of those with a trait for it.

Staying away from a sick person does not harm you or cost much.

People whose ideas repel us are often viewed as disgusting.

## Individual Differences in Superstitious Belief
There is a higher rate of obsessive-compulsive disorder in superstitious people, but generally superstition is not associated with having a psychological disorder.

Holding superstitious beliefs is associated more with Type 1 thinking (Lindeman & Aarnio, 2006).

### Magic and Witchcraft in the Twenty-First Century
Witchcraft is still practiced in parts of Africa. People prefer witchcraft as a cure for ailments and forego modern medical treatments.

### Could Superstition Help You?
Damish et al. (2010) experiment:

* One group was given the expectation that engaging in an activity would promote good luck.
* A second group was not given the expectation.

Results: Students with the expectation of good luck were more successful on a memory task.
In another experiment, students with a lucky charm persisted longer on a task and had higher self-efficacy than those without such a charm.

### When Is Superstition a Problem?
When it harms another person, as when a person is ostracized for witchcraft or for having AIDS

When it harms the superstitious person, as when a person foregoes an effective treatment for one based on superstition
