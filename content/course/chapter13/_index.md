# Quasi-Experiments and Small-N Designs

**First, watch the below short video on Quasi Experiments.**

## Quasi-Experiments

A **quasi-experimental design** is one that looks a bit like an experimental design but lacks the key ingredient -- random assignment.

## Two Examples of Independent-Groups Quasi-Experiments

### The Psychological Effects of Walking by a Church

Researchers approached 99 people who were passing by either a religious or a nonreligious landmark in one of two cities.
They selected people from each setting using systematic sampling and approached only people who were passing by---not entering or leaving the buildings.
They had each person complete a short questionnaire asking about religiosity, political views, and attitudes toward a variety of social groups.

In this study, there is an independent variable (the type of building), and several dependent variables (the attitude measures).

But people were not randomly assigned to walk by one of the buildings, so it's a quasi-experiment.

It is an example of a nonequivalent control group posttest-only design because the participants were not randomly assigned to groups, and they were tested only after exposure to one level of the independent variable or the other.

### The Psychological Effects of Cosmetic Surgery

A team of psychologists (Margraf, Meyer, & Lavallee, 2013) wanted to see if these effects actually occurred.
Even more so than with the landmark study, random assignment was obviously impossible.
Therefore, they conducted a quasi-experiment using a treatment group of people who underwent cosmetic surgery, and for a comparison group they used people who had registered at the same plastic surgery office (thereby indicating interest) but elected not to undergo surgery.

The researchers surveyed participants at four time points: before surgery, and then 3 months, 6 months, and a year after surgery (making this a pretest/posttest design).
They measured three different dependent variables: self-esteem, life satisfaction, and self-reported general attractiveness.
Those who elected to have surgery reported higher levels of self-esteem afterward.
However, remember that no variables were manipulated.

**Both use a nonequivalent control group design:** There are different participants (groups) at each level of the independent variable.
There is at least one treatment group and one comparison group, but unlike in true experiments, participants are not randomly assigned.

## Two Examples of Repeated-Measures Quasi-Experiments

### Food Breaks and Parole Decisions

People generally agree that legal decisions such as granting parole should be made as objectively as possible, so extraneous factors influencing such decisions are of particular concern.
A research team (Danziger, Levav, & Avanim-Pesso, 2011) set out to investigate the effect of food breaks on parole decisions.
All judges received these breaks, so they used a repeated-measures design.
Whether or not the prisoners came before the judge before had a break or after made a big difference in whether they were given parole.
The proportion of favorable decisions was high only at the start of the day or soon after a food break, and declined rapidly until another break occurred.
Danziger proposed that this is because the break provides time for mental rest, and the food restores blood glucose (sugar) levels.

### Assessing the Impact of Health Care Laws

In 2010, the federal government enacted the Affordable Care Act, requiring all citizens to acquire health insurance or face fines.
Four years earlier, a similar policy had been implemented in only one state: Massachusetts.
A team of public health researchers decided to evaluate whether the Massachusetts law made any difference in people's access to health care (Pande, Ross-Degnan, Zaslavsky, & Salomon, 2011).

Specifically, the researchers acquired data from a sample of over 178,000 non-elderly adults.
Some of them lived in Massachusetts (the target state), and others lived in neighboring states in New England without health insurance requirements.
The researchers used data from a national yearly survey that asks people whether they have insurance, have a personal doctor, or if they have ever gone without medical care because they couldn't afford it.

Among states without health care laws, forgoing medical care increased slightly over the years.
After 2006, residents of Massachusetts were less likely to report they had gone without care.

These designs are analogous to repeated-measures designs in true experiments: All participants experience all levels of an independent variable.

Unlike in true experiments, however, this variable is not manipulated by the researchers.

## Balancing Priorities in Quasi-Experiments

Real-world opportunities

External validity

Ethics

Construct validity and statistical validity in quasi-experiments

## Are Quasi-Experiments the Same as Correlational Studies?

Quasi-experiments can look very similar to correlational studies, and indeed they do have several characteristics in common.
This applies primarily to quasi-experiments with an independent-groups design.
Just as in correlational studies, you are comparing two or more levels of an independent variable in order to predict one or more dependent variables.

Also, just as in correlational studies, and in contrast to true experiments, quasi-experiments do not use random assignment.
Rather, researchers look for preexisting groups to study.
And just as in correlational studies, the independent variable is not manipulated by researchers.
But in contrast to correlational studies, researchers conducting quasi-experiments use a variety of techniques to enhance internal validity and perhaps give some evidence for causal claims.

In correlational studies, researchers simply select some people (such as a large survey sample, as in the Cacioppo study), measure two variables, and test the relationship between them.
In quasi-experiments, however, the researchers might obtain groups by targeting key locations (as in the religious landmarks study) or seeking out comparison groups provided by nature or by public policy (as in the judicial decision-making and Massachusetts health care studies).
Therefore, whereas correlational researchers primarily measure variables in a sample and analyze their relationships, quasi-experimental researchers more actively select groups for an independent variable.

## Small-N Designs: Studying Only a Few Individuals

The Small-N design: N refers to the number of subjects, or participants, in a study, so small-N studies by definition have relatively few participants, and sometimes only one.

When reporting the results of large-N studies, data are represented as group averages.
In contrast, individual-level data is analyzed and reported for small-N studies.

### Research on Human Memory

Henry Molaison suffered from repeated, debilitating epileptic seizures.

A surgeon excised the front half of his hippocampus on both the right and left sides

The surgery was successful in that it dramatically reduced Henry's seizures.
But as he was recovering, his family and medical staff noticed he didn't recognize the nurses and doctors caring for him.
He remembered his parents and could recall memories from before his surgery with varying levels of detail.
Yet he'd seemingly lost the ability to learn anything new.
By studying Henry and patients with similar surgeries, Scoville and Milner learned that bilateral hippocampal lesions do not affect intelligence or personality, only the ability to form new memories.

Milner, and later Suzanne Corkin and her colleagues, studied H.M.
extensively over more than 40 years.
The tasks they developed, along with the patient's gracious participation, helped document the biological separation between declarative memory, or knowing that something happened, and nondeclarative memory, knowing how to do something.

For instance, Corkin's group taught Henry to trace a star pattern with a pencil while seeing his hand only in a mirror (Corkin, 2013).
Over repeated trials, his mirror-tracing skill improved just as quickly as that of a control participant with an intact brain (this was his nondeclarative, "knowing how" memory).
But each day when he saw the task, he'd claim he'd never tried it before (his declarative, "knowing that" memory).

How convinced should we be by the results of research on special cases such as H.M.?
These studies, after all, were conducted with only a small number of participants.

**Experimental Control:** Case studies can effectively advance our knowledge when researchers use careful research designs.
Because of the empirical strengths of these studies, we can, in fact, make some conclusions.
First, Corkin and her colleagues used the power of experimental control.
In some cases, such as testing Henry's ability to remember numbers or recognize magazine photos, researchers compared his performance to age-matched control participants who had no brain damage.
Second, researchers deliberately designed tasks meant to isolate different elements of memory, such as declarative from nondeclarative memory.

**Studying Special Cases:** Just as quasi-experiments can take advantage of natural accidents, laws, or historical events, small-N studies often take advantage of special medical cases.
Studying people like Henry Moliason gave researchers the opportunity to test which kinds of tasks require hippocampal regions and which do not, under controlled conditions.

**Disadvantages of small-N studies:** Henry's cerebellum was also damaged from antiseizure medications.
The multiple types of damage make it more difficult to narrow down the specific region responsible for each behavioral deficit---an internal validity issue.
Another disadvantage involves external validity: Participants in small-N studies may not represent the general population very well.
We cannot be sure whether results from studies on surgery patients would apply to people with no history of epilepsy or schizophrenia.
Furthermore, it clearly would be unethical to remove regions of a nonepileptic person's brain to create the necessary comparison.

### Studying How Children Think Using a Small-N Design

Jean Piaget (1923) was a developmental psychologist interested in cognitive development in children.
He developed his theory in large part through careful observations of his own three children.
Ideas like conservation of liquid, in which younger children think there is more liquid when it is poured into a taller but more slender glass, came from these observations.
Although three is obviously a very small N, Piaget used very careful, systematic observation, well-defined constructs, and extensive replication to support his conclusions.

### Other Examples of Small-N Studies: Ebbinghaus

Hermann Ebbinghaus (1913) was an experimental psychologist who conducted a series of memory studies.
He made himself memorize long lists long lists of nonsense syllables, such as ponand mip, then documented how many syllables he remembered at different time intervals.
This figure illustrates the forgetting curve described by Ebbinghaus.
These studies had an N of just one: the researcher himself.
But again through precise experimental control and measurement, and careful replication, these studies became a great contribution to the field.

## Evaluating the Four Validities in Small-N Designs

**Internal validity:** The examples in this chapter are all of very well-constructed studies.
For the reasons we discussed, the internal validity of all of them is high.

**External validity:** This is easy to question in small-N designs, but the goals of the research are not always to generalize to other populations.
Example: Medical studies on treatments for rare illnesses necessarily have a small number of participants, but if the goal of such research is only to treat that rare disease, then generalization is not relevant.
Research can take steps to maximize the external validity of their findings.
They can triangulate by combining the results of single-N studies with other studies on animals or other groups, as the team did when comparing H.M.'s results with subsequent research on people without brain damage.

**Construct validity:** No matter what kind of study you are conducting, always be careful about defining your variables well.
Construct validity is fairly straightforward when researchers are recording whether a person with a brain lesion reports seeing this picture or that one, and for objective measures such as memory for a string of numbers.
But when researchers are recording the distance a child gets to a dog or whether a person is ruminating, they should use multiple observers and check for interrater reliability, in case an observer is biased or the behavior is difficult to identify.

**Statistical validity:** Due to their unique design, small-N studies often do not rely on traditional parametric statistics to draw their conclusions.
Often the effect is so strong that simply looking at a visual summary of the results (such as the graphs for the behavioral change studies) is enough to convey the power of the experimental manipulation.
However, researchers should always be careful to treat data appropriately when drawing conclusions.
