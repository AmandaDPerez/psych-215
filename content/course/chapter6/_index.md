# Surveys and Observations

## Construct Validity of Surveys and Polls

Survey/poll: They are a method of asking people questions face-to-face, on the phone, on written questionnaires, or online.

**Construct Validity**: 

* Choosing question formats  
* Writing well-worded questions  
* Encouraging accurate responses

## Surveys and Polls

### Open-ended questions: Respondents may answer any way they like. 

*What do you think of this class?*

**Pro**: They provide researchers with a lot of rich information. 

**Con**: Processing the coding and categorizing diverse responses can be difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, researchers sometimes restrict the answers that people provide.

### Forced-choice format: People provide their opinion by choosing the best of two or more options. 

*Do you like this class so far?* Yes or No

**Likert scale**: People are presented with a statement and asked to use a rating scale to reflect their degree of agreement. Anchored by the terms strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree.

*How difficult is this class?*
Easy 1 2 3 4 5 Hard

## Writing Well-Worded Questions

**Leading questions**: Sometimes two questions seem to be asking the same thing, but they yield very different responses depending on how they are worded. Questions should be worded as neutrally as possible.

*How fast do you think the car was going when he HIT the other car?* VS *How fast do you think the car was going when he SMASHED into the other car?*

**Double-barreled questions**: Asking two questions in one.

*Do you enjoy swimming and wearing sunscreen?* Yes, No

**Negative wording**: The more cognitively difficult a question is for people to answer, the more confusion there will be, which can reduce the construct validity of the item. Using double negatives can make questions more difficult for respondents to process.

*People who do not drive with a suspended license should never be punished *  
Disagree   1   2   3   4   5  Agree

**Question order**: Earlier items can influence the way respondents interpret later items. 

Suppose the first item on the survey is rather sensitive. That might influence the way respondents answer subsequent questions because they were "primed" by the first item.

*One way to control for order effects is to randomize question order.*

## Encouraging Accurate Responses

People can give meaningful responses, but sometimes people use shortcuts:

(1) **Response sets**: aka nondifferentiation): a way of answering a number of questions in the same way (e.g., strongly disagree). 
* Response sets weaken construct validity because respondents aren't saying what they really think.

(2) **Acquiescence**: a type of response set in which people answer positively (yes, strongly agree, agree) to a number of items instead of looking at each item individually. 

* For example, a respondent might answer "5" to every item on Diener's scale of subjective well-being., not because he is a happy person, but rather because he is using a yea-saying shortcut. People have a bias to agree with (say "yes" to) any item-no matter what it states (Krosnick, 1999).

* can threaten construct validity because instead of measuring the construct of true feelings of well-being, the survey could be measuring the tendency to agree or the lack of motivation to think carefully.

(3) **Fence sitting**: Another shortcut is to play it safe by choosing the response in the middle of the scale for all items. This is referred to as fence sitting. This might involve providing a neutral response or responding, "I don't know." 

* Weakens construct validity when respondents actually have a positive or negative opinion but their responses indicate neutrality. 

* It is difficult to distinguish fence sitters from those who truly feel neutral. 

* One solution is to remove the neutral (center) option so there are an even number of options. Another solution is to use forced choice.  

### More Impediments to Accurate Responses

**Trying to look good**

* Socially desirable responding/faking good: Trying to look better than we are (smarter, stronger, thinner, happier, more successful). 
* Faking bad: This is less common, but sometimes respondents try to look bad (more aggressive, more deviant, nastier). 

* Most of us like to look good in other people's eyes, so why shouldn't this extend to the way we respond on surveys?

* One way to avoid this is to remind respondents that their responses are anonymous, include special items in the survey to identify socially desirable responders, or use computerized measures to evaluate attitudes about sensitive topics


**Self-reporting "more than they can know"**

* Are people capable of reporting accurately about their feelings, thoughts, and behavior? 

* For example, if I ask you why you always buy a particular brand of yogurt, you might not really know why, yet you may tell me something that sounds reasonable. 

**Self-reporting memories of events**

* What about self-reporting memories of behaviors? 

* For example, when was the last time you took your car to the car wash? What were you wearing on your 21st birthday? 

* People's memories for events are not as accurate as they might like to believe. Furthermore, confidence and accuracy are not related.

**Rating products**

* One study found little correspondence between five-star ratings on Amazon and the ratings of the same products by Consumer Reports. Consumers' ratings were, instead, correlated with the cost of the product and the prestige of its brand. 

* Studies like these suggest that people may not always be able to accurately report on the quality of products they buy.    

## Construct Validity of Behavioral Observations

**Observational research:** a researcher watches people or animals and systematically records their actions.

Many researchers think that observing behavior is better than relying on self-report, given the issues we've discussed with the accuracy of self-report.

**Observing how much people talk**: Researcher Matthias Mehl, at the U of Arizona, has developed an electronically activated recorder (EAR) to observe what people say in everyday conversations. The EAR has a microphone and a digital recording device. Every 12.5 minutes the EAR records for 30 seconds. Then research assistants transcribe what the person said while being recorded. 

* Mehl and his colleagues found that despite stereotypes of women being more talkative than men, women did not use significantly more words than men as recorded by the EAR (Mehl et al., 2007). 

### Some Claims Based on Observational Data

**Observing hockey moms and dads**: In Canada, it wasn't unusual to hear in the popular media about parents acting aggressively at youth ice hockey games. Canadian researchers wanted to see how common this was, so they observed a sample of hockey games and recorded the frequency of both violent, negative behavior and positive, supportive behavior by parents. 

* Researchers found that 64% of parents' comments were positive, and only 4% were negative (Bowker et al., 2009). The results from this observational research did not support the reports in the media of parental violence.

**Observing families in the evening**: In this research, both parents from dual-earner families were followed by a camera crew from the time they left work until 8 p.m. (Campos et al., 2013). Then a variety of behaviors were coded from the videotapes, including the emotional tone of the parents and the topics of the conversations during dinner. 

* Emotional tone was slightly positive (4.2/7). 
Topics of dinner conversations: Children were more likely to complain about the taste of the food, whereas parents were more likely to talk about how nutritious the food was. 

### Observations Can Be Better Than Self-Reports

Making reliable and valid observations

But...Observer bias

#### Observer Bias: When observers' expectations influence their interpretations of participants' behaviors or the outcome of the research. 

Observers rate behaviors according to their own expectations or hypotheses instead of rating behaviors objectively.

Let's say that we all watched a videotape of a man in his mid-20s being interviewed. Before viewing the video, half of you were told that the man was a graduate student and half of you were told that he was a criminal. 

*Do you think this might influence your opinions of this man?*

**Observer effects**: when observers change the behavior of the participants to match the observer's expectations; also known as expectancy effects.

**Bright and dull rats**: Psychology undergrads were given five rats and told to see how long it took for the rats to learn to run a maze (Rozenthal & Fode, 1963) . Each student was given a randomly selected group of rats. Half of the students were told that their rats were bred to be "maze-bright" and half were told they were bred to be "maze-dull." 

* The rats were actually all genetically similar, but the "maze-bright" rats ran the maze faster each day with fewer mistakes, whereas the "maze-dull" rats did not improve their performance over several days of testing. 

* The study demonstrated that sometimes observers' expectations can influence the behavior of those they're observing.

## Preventing Observer Bias and Observer Effects

**Masked research design**: One way to prevent observer bias and observer effects is to use a masked design (blind design). 

In a masked design, the observers do not know to which conditions the participants have been assigned, and they are not aware of what the study is about. 

Researchers need well-trained observers, and clear rating scales or codebooks is important.

In order to assess the construct validity of a coded measure, multiple observers can be used to determine the interrater reliability of the measures. If interrater reliability is low, then observers might need to be retrained, a clearer coding system for behaviors needs to be used, or both. 

*Remember that just because a measure is reliable, that doesn't mean it's valid.*

## Reactivity: When Participants React to Being Watched

**Reactivity**: when people change their behavior in some way when they know that someone else is watching them. 

For example, let's say you want to do some observational research in a preschool setting. 

If you simply walked in one day and sat down in the classroom to begin your observations, the children and teachers might change their behavior in a variety of ways. 

The children might be curious about what you're doing there and ask you a lot of questions. Some children might be afraid of you. The teachers might feel their teaching is being assessed. 

**Solution 1**: Blend in. Make yourself less obvious by sitting in the back of the classroom or by being in an adjacent room behind a one-way mirror in a setting that's designed for such observations. The goal is to make unobtrusive observations to prevent reactivity. 
**Solution 2**: Wait it out. Sometimes it's a good idea to have research participants get used to your presence by visiting a number of times so that they become more familiar with you being around.

**Solution 3**: Measure the behavior's results. Instead of actually measuring behaviors, sometimes researchers obtain unobtrusive data by measuring traces of a behavior.

For example, if you were interested in the amount and types of junk food that college students eat in the dorm, you could look at the wrappers in the dorm's garbage cans.  

## Observing People Ethically

*Is it ethical for researchers to observe the behaviors of others?*

Short answer: It depends.

Most researchers think it's ethical to observe people's behavior in public places such as at concerts, on campus, and at the bus stop. Scientists don't specifically identify the people they observe when they report their research findings. 

The use of one-way mirrors or hidden cameras might be considered ethical in some situations. 
But in order to observe people's private behaviors, researchers need to get permission in advance.
