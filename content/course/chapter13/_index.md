## Concepts of Normal Behavior 
Normal is statistically average, typical behavior that conforms to sociocultural expectations.

Normal is a low standard because normal people start fights, bully others, lie, and engage in other antisocial behaviors. 

## Other Concepts of Abnormal Behavior 
Abnormal behavior is:

* Objectionable, morally deficient behavior
* Unusual/bizarre/strange/aberrant behavior
* A sign of mental illness (medical model)

## Use the "MAD" Acronym
To decide if a person likely has a serious psychological problem

| Is the person's behavior: |
|-|
| **Maladaptive?** Does the person's behavior bother other people, interfere with his or her functioning, or get in the way of his or her effectiveness in adaptively responding to stimuli in the environment? |
| **Abnormal?** Is the behavior very unusual, excessive, and of long duration in ways that cannot be attributed to the context in which it appears? |
| **Distressing?** Does the person find his or her behavior bothersome, making life unpleasant or troubled? |

## Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
To answer these questions, we use a system for assigning people to categories of disorders.

Categorizing people involves putting them in one group (disorder) versus another using diagnostic features, signs, or symptoms.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) uses criteria and decision rules to assign a classification and label (diagnosis) to mental disorders. 

### The Most Commonly Diagnosed Mental Disorders 
Nearly 20% are diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder. 

More than 15% are diagnosed with depression.

### Approach to Mental Disorders
DSM organizes mental disorders into categories. It makes **qualitative** distinctions between people who have specific mental disorders and those who do not.

It assumes that certain symptoms cluster together and have a characteristic course or outcome, forming a **syndrome**, which underlies the mental disorder.

### Approach to Diagnosis
The particular clusters of signs, symptoms, and behaviors differentiate one disorder from another.

If someone has a designated number of certain symptoms, DSM permits classification of the person as having a specific disorder.

### Major Depression in DSM-5
The symptoms, signs, and behaviors that tend to cluster together for major depression are found in the DSM-5 criteria on table below.

Diagnosis of major depression requires criterion (symptom) 1 or 2; in addition, any four other symptoms must be present during the same 2-week period. 

| Does the person: |
|-|
| 1. Show depressed mood much of the day, on most days (for at least 2 weeks)? |
| 2. Show diminished interest in pleasurable activities? |
| 3. Show significant weight loss, not due to dieting?|
| 4. Experience sleep disturbances (a lack of or too much sleep)?|
| 5. Show agitation, restlessness, or slowing?|
| 6. Show signs of fatigue or loss of energy almost every day? |
| 7. Report feelings of worthlessness? |
| 8. Show signs of problems in concentrating or being indecisive? |
| 9. Have recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, or has he or she attempted suicide? |

#### Can Someone Be More Or Less Depressed? 
No, according to the DSM approach, which assumes that having a disorder is an "all-or-none" kind of thing. 

A person either meets the criteria for diagnosis of major depression or does not.

## Diagnoses Have Been Increasing
Based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria, during their lifetime about half of the U.S. population will be diagnosed with a mental disorder.

From 1987 to 1997, the number of people treated for depression increased by 300%.

In the last two decades, the diagnosis of autism greatly increased from about 1 in 150 to 1 in 60. 

### Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism
Epidemiological studies have clearly refuted the claim that the MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) vaccine caused the increase in autism. 

Out of fear, many parents resisted vaccination of their children with MMR vaccines, resulting in an increase in deaths from these preventable diseases.

#### What Is Causing Autism Diagnoses to Increase?
Diagnostic categories in DSM have become more inclusive and numerous, leading to more possible diagnoses. 

In 1952, DSM-I had only 106 diagnoses and 128 pages. By 2013, DSM-5 included more than 300 diagnoses and 946 pages. 

### Over-Diagnosis of Mental Disorders
Rosenhan (1973) and four other mental health professionals without mental disorders presented themselves to 12 different psychiatric hospitals. They claimed to hear voices that said "thud," "empty," and "hollow."

All five were diagnosed with schizophrenia.

They showed no more symptoms and claimed to be recovered, but were kept longer and made to agree they had a disorder and to take antipsychotic drugs.

##  Criticism: DSM Disorders Are Arbitrary
An APA task force decides if something is a disorder, sometimes after a consensus of task force members come to agreement.

Homosexuality used to be a mental disorder, but it was voted out.

DSM disorders are not based enough on scientific research.

## What Is Clinical Assessment?
Systematically collecting and evaluating information about a client from many sources to make a diagnosis:

* Case history data
* Interviews with client and family members
* Behavioral observations
* Information from a mental status examination
Also used to track progress in therapy

### Making a Good DSM Diagnosis
**Differential diagnosis:** A diagnosis that shows the signs, symptoms, and behaviors of a person meet the criteria and best fit one diagnostic label while ruling out other diagnostic labels for the same set of signs, symptoms, and behaviors.

### Comorbidity
Comorbidity: Diagnosis of more than one disorder.

People often show signs, symptoms, and behaviors that fit more than one diagnostic category. They may require a "dual diagnosis." 

Substance abuse disorder is the mental disorder that is most often comorbid with other disorders.

## Thinking Errors in Clinical Psychology
**Rapid diagnosis (hasty generalization):** Making a diagnosis within a few minutes.

**Excessive backward reasoning:** Relying too much on preconceptions and expectations, looking for data that support the clinician's hypothesis rather than looking at the client data and then forming a hypothesis. 

**Behavioral confirmation:** Behaving toward a client in a way that elicits behaviors that confirm the hypothesis the clinician already has about a client's problem. 

**Hindsight bias:** Knowing the outcome of a situation and the nature of a client's problem may make it appear almost inevitable in hindsight. 

**Bias:** These effects can be caused by preconceptions, stereotypes, and the clinician's background knowledge. 

Clinicians are susceptible to thinking errors, such as inappropriate use of availability as they readily access vivid details and recent experiences of cases. 

## Fixing Thinking Errors
| Thinking Error | Description | How to Fix It |
|-|-|-|
| Reification | Assuming that a hypothetical construct, such as a mental disorder, is a real, concrete entity | Realize that a mental disorder is an operationally defined and created construct.|
| Mistaking diagnosis for a cause |Thinking that a diagnosis is a cause of behavior or a mental problem|Realize that a diagnosis is a label for a classification.|
| Forer or Barnum effect| Assuming that a general description of a person is predictive and diagnostic| Use more detailed, specific information about signs, symptoms, and behaviors.|
| Rapid diagnosis (hasty generalization) |Quickly diagnosing a mental disorder without considering relevant criteria and all relevant signs and symptoms| Conduct a more thorough assessment and a differential diagnosis.|
| Excessive backward reasoning |Relying too much on preconceptions, expectations, and stereotypes to guide reasoning| Engage in more forward reasoning, paying more attention to the data.|
| Behavioral confirmation (self-fulfilling prophesy) |Eliciting certain behaviors from a client that confirm the clinician's expectations about the client| Remain open to other interpretations of a client's behavior and use objective measures to assess the behavior. |

## Clinical Approach
The clinical approach refers to the subjective and intuitive judgments that clinicians ordinarily make. 

This approach is subject to the human fallibility of clinicians. 

When clinicians fail to systematically assess all relevant information, they are excessively relying on intuition. In such a case, the mechanical approach is superior.

### Improving Clinical Reasoning

| Guidelines for Improving Clinical Reasoning |
|-|
| 1. Collect high-quality data on clients, using reliable and valid measures and assessments.|
| 2. Take into account contextual, situational, and background knowledge that might affect the collection and interpretation of client data.|
| 3. Generate multiple hypotheses from different perspectives about a client's problem. |
| 4. Avoid hindsight bias, stereotypes, preconceptions, and bias from heuristics. |
| 5. Use relevant base rate information and probabilities to make judgments and predictions.|
| 6. Test hypotheses about clients' data and seek to disconfirm them. |
| 7. Select the hypothesis that best fits the data, weighing intuitions and personal experience less in judgments, and accurately assessing confidence in your conclusions.|
| 8. Seek and use reliable and valid feedback on the quality of your reasoning and judgments.|
