### Exams
There will be a total of 3 Exams administered via canvas quizzes. They will be based on material from lectures and readings and will consist of multiple choice questions and occasionally some short answers. The exams are not cumulative and will only cover new untested material. I have a strong belief in rewarding growth and improvement. Therefore, your 3 exams will be weighted such that your higher scoring exams will be worth more. Exams are open-notes, open-book, and un-timed. 

### Practical Thinking (PT) Essays
PT exercises will help  assess your knowledge and ability to apply new concepts and develop specifically targeted skills. They will also provide you with a wide variety of CT tasks intended to help you learn how to think like a psychologist. Finally, these PT exercises will allow for critical reading and analysis of discussions related to fascinating psychological questions. There are a total of 5 PT Essays due throughout the course. You will submit each PT Essay via a word document or PDF on Canvas assignments.

### Videos
Ihave selected 3 videos (John Oliver on Scientific Studies, Bill Nye, & Astrology on Pseudoscience) to accompany week 1, week 6, and week 12, respectively.  You are to watch the videos and submit a response (few sentences) on Canvas assignments.

## Course Policies

<b>Student Contact and Canvas/Piazza.</b> I will regularly send announcements through Piazza. It is your responsibility to regularly check Piazza for announcements and assignments. 

<b>Academic Integrity.</b> Do NOT cheat. Do NOT plagiarize. To copy text or ideas from another source is plagiarism. Anyone caught cheating or plagiarizing will receive a zero for the assignment, and I will submit a Report of Academic Dishonesty to the college. For more information, read the DVC Procedure 4001.04 Academic Dishonesty policy (on Canvas).

<b>Strategies for success.</b> Do your readings, complete assignments on time, understand how the topics and information relate to what you’ve learned (and are learning), and if you don’t understand something, please ask the question! If you stop attending lecture and / or turning in assignments and do not respond to e-mail, I will drop you from the class to avoid giving you an F.

<b>Most important.</b> Let me know as soon as anything in your life starts to interfere with your ability to do well in this class (e.g. sickness, work/housing/family issues, mental health crisis, etc.), so I can work with you on a plan to succeed. There’s more I can do earlier in the semester than at the end.

## Description of Student Support Services

<b>Student Community Groups:</b> Many students benefit from being part of an on-campus community outside the classroom. In addition to the many student clubs DVC offers, DVC also offers three college access and success programs - Puente, Umoja, and Mesa. Learn more at the PUMA Center on campus |  www.dvc.edu/current/learning-community/puma/

<b>Undocumented Students:</b> I believe that all people deserve access to education, and serve the college as an ally to undocumented students. The DVC Dreamers Alliance has organized resources to support undocumented students, protect their rights, and offer potential financial aid | www.dvc.edu/student-services/dvc-dreamers/

<b>Students with Disabilities:</b> Students who require support or adaptive equipment because of a specific disability -- or would like to be tested to see if they qualify for a learning, auditory, or visual disability -- can request these services through the Disability Support Services (DSS) office. Please note that I can only provide accommodations authorized by the DSS office. [SSC-248 | (925) 969-2182 | www.dvc.edu/dss/]

<b>Students with Mental Health Issues:</b> If you feel a mental health issue (e.g., depression, anxiety) is negatively impacting your ability to succeed, I’d highly encourage you to seek out experts who can help. The college is now partnering with clinical interns at JFK University to offer free, one-to-one short term therapy treatment plans. Students may be referred by an instructor, counselor, or may seek out treatment themselves. [WellnessDVC@email.4cd.edu | 925-969-2148]
